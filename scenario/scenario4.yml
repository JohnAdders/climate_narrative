description: 
  No actions are initially taken in this scenario. Only after some years the global policy
  starts to change.


  An instantenuous shift to strict low carbon economy is undertaken, resulting in a massive
  transition risk to the global economy. However, it turns out that even these severe actions
  are not sufficient to compensate for the years of no-action.


  As a result, despite the significant efforts of the world it is not possible to contain the
  global warming level to the 2 degree area, and physical risk is relatively high.
