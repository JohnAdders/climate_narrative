  These Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios assume that effective policy
  changes are introduced in a timely manner.

  The NGFS have defined two orderly scenarios:

  - **Net Zero 2050** limits global warming to 1.5&deg;C through stringent climate
    policies and innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around 2050.
    Some jurisdictions such as the US, EU and Japan reach Net Zero for all GHGs.

  - **Below 2&deg;C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving
    a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2&deg;C.

  ## Key assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occurs gradually. This is
  achieved by an immediate and smooth policy reaction decarbonising the energy
  supply, accelerating electrification and switching to low-carbon fuels in
  industry, transport and buildings, deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and
  storage and increasing afforestation.

  The price of carbon is higher in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to a Below
  2&deg;C scenario, this is due to more rigorous targets of limiting global warming
  to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C set in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. In both the scenarios
  the gradual but significant rise in emission prices gives rise to transition
  risk.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above
  1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and
  the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical
  cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves has more than doubled. (See Kaufman, 
  D. et al. (2020)).

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the 
  atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are extremely 
  likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. 
  In early/orderly transition risk scenarios global mean temperatures are 
  projected to increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.7&deg;C, compared to 
  pre-industrial levels, with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes 
  experiencing higher warming giving rise to low physical risk.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding.

  In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -1.5% and-2.5%
  by 2050. GDP losses were calculated based on the methodology set out in Kalkuhl 
  and Wenz (2020) at the country level for the change in average temperature in 
  each scenario compared to the previous year. The methodology does not include 
  impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level rise or wider societal impacts from 
  migration or conflict. For given countries these would likely strongly increase 
  the physical risk. These estimates also do not fully capture adaptation, which 
  would reduce impacts but require significant investment. World GDP losses from 
  physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time. 
  GDP impacts from transition risk are slightly positive in the Net Zero 2050 
  scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs 
  are more than offset by the recycling of carbon tax revenues into government 
  investment and lower employment taxes.

  Note GDP losses highlighted in the above graph were calculated based on the 
  methodology set out in Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) at the country level for the 
  change in average temperature in each scenario compared to the previous year. 
  The methodology does not include impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level 
  rise or wider societal impacts from migration or conflict. For given countries 
  these would likely strongly increase the physical risk. These estimates also do 
  not fully capture adaptation, which would reduce impacts but require significant 
  investment.

  Overall, these are relatively optimistic scenarios as both transition and
  physical risks are limited. Any policies that are either introduced or changed are
  assumed to take place efficiently with little variation between countries and
  sectors. Similarly, the development and deployment of alternative technologies
  are expected to take place without significant difficulty. For example, the
  availability of Carbon dioxide removal technologies which involves removing
  carbon from the atmosphere through increasing forest cover and soil
  sequestration or growing crops for bioenergy doesn't pose a significant
  challenge in either orderly scenario.
