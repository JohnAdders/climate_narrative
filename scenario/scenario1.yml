description:
  This scenario assumes that effective policy changes are introduced in a timely manner.


  As a result, global net emission of CO<sub>2</sub> gradually decreases to zero and the global warming
  extent is limited (likely below 2 degrees).


  This is a relatively optimistic scenario as both transition and physical risks are manageable.
