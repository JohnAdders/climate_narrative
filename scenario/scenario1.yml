name: Orderly
transition: low
physical: low
description:
  This scenario assumes that effective policy changes are introduced in a timely manner.


  As a result, global net emission of CO<sub>2</sub> gradually decreases to zero and the global warming
  extent is limited (likely below 2 degrees). See the graph below for possible pathways

  The orderly transition scenario is a relatively optimistic scenario as 
  both transition and physical risks are manageable.
