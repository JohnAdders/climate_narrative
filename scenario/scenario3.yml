These scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming leading to high physical risk.

The NGFS have provided two hot house world scenarios:


* Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) includes all pledged policies even if not yet implemented.


* Current Policies assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risk.


## Key physical assumptions and parameters 


In these scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease sufficiently to prevent significant temperature rises resulting in high physical risk.

Carbon price is a measure of overall policy intensity. Emission prices are sensitive to the timing of policy implementation. With none or relatively small additions to current policy, these scenarios have low carbon prices throughout. Therefore, transition risk is not relevant for these scenarios.

Observed climate change of 1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, has already
more than doubled both the global land area and the global population annually exposed
to river flood, crop failure, tropical cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves.


In these scenarios global mean temperatures could increase across the world by 2.5&deg;C
to 3&deg;C with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming.

These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health,
labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise.
It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,
wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding.


In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -2.8% and -4.8% by 2050.
World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time.

Selected climate variables can be explored through the NGFS CA Climate Impact Explorer
hosted by Climate Analytics. Additional data are available via the ISIMIP project. 


Overall, these scenarios result in high physical risk including irreversible impacts like
sea-level rise. Transition risks are not relevant in these scenarios as only policies that
are already implemented or pledged are in place.
