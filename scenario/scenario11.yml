These low transition and physical risk scenarios assume that effective policy changes are introduced in a timely manner.

The NGFS have defined two orderly scenarios:


* **Net Zero 2050** limits global warming to 1.5°C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO2 emissions around 2050. Some jurisdictions such as the US, EU and Japan reach Net Zero for all GHGs.


* **Below 2°C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C.


### Key transition and physical assumptions and parameters 

In these scenarios the reduction in CO2 emissions occurs gradually. This is achieved by an immediate and smooth policy reaction decarbonising the energy supply, accelerating electrification and switching to low-carbon fuels in industry, transport and buildings, deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and increasing afforestation.

The price of carbon is higher in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to a Below 2°C scenario, this is due to more rigorous targets of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C set in the Net Zero 2050 scenario.   In both the scenarios the gradual but significant rise in emission prices gives rise to low transition risk.

Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above 1.2°C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves has more than doubled.


In these scenarios global mean temperatures could increase across the world by 1.5°C to 1.7°C, compared to pre-industrial levels, with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming  giving rise to low physical risk.

These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding.


In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -1.5% and-2.5% by 2050 . World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time. GDP impacts from transition risk are slightly positive in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are more than offset by the recycling of carbon revenues into government investment and lower employment taxes.

Overall, these are relatively optimistic scenarios as both transition and physical risks are low. Any policies that are either introduced or changed are assumed to take place efficiently with little variation between countries and sectors. Similarly, the development and deployment of alternative technologies are expected to take place without significant difficulty. For example, the availability of Carbon dioxide removal technologies which involves removing carbon from the atmosphere through increasing forest cover and soil sequestration or growing crops for bioenergy doesn’t pose a significant challenge in either orderly scenario.
