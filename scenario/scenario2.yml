These high transition risk scenarios assume the introduction of effective policy change is delayed or divergent across countries and sectors.

The NGFS have provided two disorderly scenarios:


* **Divergent Net Zero** reaches net zero globally around 2050 but with higher costs
in the short-term due to substitute technology and divergent policies being adopted
across sectors leading to a quicker phase out of oil use.


* **Delayed transition** assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030.
Strong policies are needed to limit warming to below 2&deg;C by 2050. CO<sub>2</sub> removal
is limited.


## Key transition and physical assumptions and parameters 


In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action enables a \"fossil recovery\"
out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, which results in emissions increasing
until 2030. Policies drive a sharp decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate
for the inaction beforehand. In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction enables a \"fossil recovery\"
out of the economic crisis, which delays the increase of carbon prices until 2030,
compared to the Divergent Net Zero scenario where carbon prices rise at a smoother rate
because while there are varied policies implemented across countries and sectors these measures
have been put in place earlier. In both the scenarios disorderly policy action results in
high transition risk.

Observed climate change on 1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels,
has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population
annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves. 


In these scenarios global mean temperatures could increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C
to 1.8&deg;C with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming.

These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health,
labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise.
It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves,
droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding.


In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -4.2% and -4.8% by 2050.
World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time.
World GDP impacts from high transition risk are negative as the speed of the transition
combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment.
In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and transition risks in 2050.

Overall, the Delayed transition scenario creates a risk of leaving very little or no time
to develop and deploy counter measures. This leaves a limited timeframe for companies
and the population to adapt to these changes. In a Divergent Net Zero scenario, it would be
difficult to implement consistent and agreeable policies across different regions.
