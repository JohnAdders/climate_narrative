name: Disorderly
transition: high
physical: low
description: 
  In this scenario the world does not implement the mitigated actions in next few years.
  Only later necessary political decisions are taken.

  The level of two degrees remains the global target, therefore in order to catch up
  more pronounced and faster changes are required than in the 'orderly' scenario,
  allowing little or no time for the companies and people to adapt.


  Ultimately, the global warming level is limited, at the expense of considerable transition risk
  (massive changes are required in a relatively short period of time).
