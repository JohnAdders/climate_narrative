<h2 class="unlisted unnumbered">Summary of NGFS Orderly Scenarios</h2>
<p>The Orderly transition risk scenarios could result in a gradual
reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and an increase in the carbon
price. The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies
are projected to increase (e.g. annual investment in low carbon
increases from ~750 billion USD to between ~2 trillion USD and ~3
trillion USD by 2030). Global mean temperatures are projected to
increase across the world by 1.6°C to 1.7°C, compared to pre-industrial
levels, by 2050.</p>
<p>These scenarios could lead to chronic changes in living conditions
affecting health, labour productivity (a decrease in labour productivity
due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour
under hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and
sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of
weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and
flooding. The total cumulative relative GDP impact is estimated to be
between -1.5% and -2.5% by 2050.</p>
<div id="summary-of-agriculture-sector" class="section level5">
<h5>Summary of Agriculture Sector</h5>
<p>The Agriculture sector continues to expand to feed and supply

evolutions.</p>
<p>By 2050, the Orderly transition risk scenarios driven by societal
change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely
to have a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Agricultural
value chains face material climate transition risk exposure due to their
emissions intensity and reliance on land. A potential expansion of land
protection policies and carbon payments made to preserve and expand
forests could reduce land available for agriculture.</p>
<p>These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in
GDP growth and could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand
for the agriculture sector, although the impact is likely to be limited
due to inelastic demand for food products.</p>

<h2 class="unlisted unnumbered">Summary of NGFS Disorderly
Scenarios</h2>
<p>Disorderly transition risk scenarios assume the introduction of
effective policy change is delayed or divergent across countries and
sectors. In the Delayed transition scenario, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do
not decrease until 2030, and steep increase in the carbon price is
required thereafter to compensate for this inaction.In the Divergent Net
Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to occur
earlier and as a result is more gradual, and carbon prices rise at a
smoother rate. In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the investments
in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to
increase (e.g. annual investment in low carbon technologies increases
from ~750 billion USD to ~3 trillion USD by 2050). Global mean
temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 1.6°C to
1.8°C, compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2050.</p>
<p>The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could lead to chronic
changes in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity (a
decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human
body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions),
agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further change
the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves,
droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. The total cumulative
relative GDP impact is estimated to be between -4.2% and -4.8% by
2050.</p>

and financiers to emerging climate related transition risks through
public policies, consumer demand shifts and technological
evolutions.</p>
<p>By 2050, in the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action
enables a “fossil recovery” out of the economic crisis brought about by
COVID-19. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030, before sharply
decreasing after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the
Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent reduction in
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. These scenarios are likely to have a

material climate transition risk exposure due to their emissions
intensity and reliance on land. Under these scenarios, the expansion of
land protection policies and carbon payments made to preserve and expand
forests could reduce land available for agriculture.</p>

<div id="summary-of-ngfs-hot-house-world-scenarios"
class="section level2 unlisted unnumbered">
<h2 class="unlisted unnumbered">Summary of NGFS Hot House World
Scenarios</h2>
<p>In the Hot House World scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not
decrease and carbon prices to not increase sufficiently to prevent
significant temperature rises resulting in high physical risk. In these
scenarios global mean temperatures are projected to increase across the
world by ~2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2050.</p>
<p>This could lead to a significant chronic change in living conditions
affecting health, labour productivity (a decrease in labour productivity
due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour
under hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and
sea-level rise. It can also change the frequency and severity of weather
events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
The total cumulative relative GDP impact is estimated to be between
-2.8% and -4.8% by 2050.</p>
<div id="summary-of-agriculture-sector-2" class="section level5">
<h5>Summary of Agriculture Sector</h5>
<p>The Agriculture sector is also exposed to physical risk. Chronic
effects (e.g. raised sea-levels and mean temperatures) and acute effects
due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as
heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding are adding to pressures on
global agricultural and food systems and could lead to severe disruption
to agricultural production which could impact the profitability for some
companies in long-run. Whilst the agriculture sector is used to
responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high
physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming could increase
weather variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to
agriculture sector which could impact profitability.</p>
<p>Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to
a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for
agriculture, although the impact is likely to be limited due to
inelastic demand for food products.</p>

<h1>NGFS Orderly Scenarios</h1>
<p>These Orderly transition risk scenarios assume that effective policy
changes are introduced in a timely manner.</p>

<p>The NGFS have defined two orderly scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Net Zero 2050</strong> limits global warming to 1.5°C
through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching global Net
Zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around 2050. Some jurisdictions such as
the US, EU and Japan reach Net Zero for all GHGs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Below 2°C</strong> gradually increases the stringency of
climate policies, giving a 67% chance of limiting global warming to
below 2°C.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="key-assumptions-and-parameters" class="section level3">
<h3>Key assumptions and parameters</h3>
<p>In these scenarios the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occurs
gradually. This is achieved by an immediate and smooth policy reaction
decarbonising the energy supply, accelerating electrification and
switching to low-carbon fuels in industry, transport and buildings,
deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and increasing
afforestation and reforestation.</p>

<p>The price of carbon is higher in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to
a Below 2°C scenario, this is due to more rigorous targets of limiting
global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C set in the Net Zero 2050 scenario.
In both the scenarios the gradual but significant rise in emission
prices gives rise to transition risk.</p>

global averages.</a></p>
<p>The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are
projected to increase in Orderly transition risk scenarios. These are
expected to be higher in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to a Below
2°C scenario. Overall, firms could be required to readjust their capital
expenditure in line with these trends; developing more efficient and
less carbon intensive products and services in order to adhere to carbon
pricing policies. The technologies that result from these investments
could also adjust asset valuations of relatively older technology.
Annual investment in energy efficiency increases from ~200 billion USD
(inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between ~500 billion USD and
~750 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon
technologies increases from ~750 billion USD to between ~2.5 trillion
USD and ~3 trillion USD by 2050.</p>

<p>Observed climate change has already increased global mean
temperatures above 1.2°C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both
the global land area and the global population annually exposed to river
flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves has more
than doubled. (See Kaufman, D. et al. (2020)).</p>
<p>The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
oxide in the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000
years and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of
warming since the mid-20th century. In these scenarios global mean
temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 1.6°C to
1.7°C, compared to pre-industrial levels by 2050, with land warming
faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming giving
rise to low physical risk.</p>

<p>These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions
affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and
sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of
weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and
flooding. For example, in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, we could see the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the
human body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate
conditions.</li>
</ul>

target="_blank">Climate Impact Explorer.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to
increase, peaking at a ~140% increase over a 1986-2006 reference period
around 2050, and remaining ~120% above the reference period thereafter.
Annual economic damages from cyclones are also projected to increase,
but to a lesser extent; ~10% above reference period levels from 2030
onwards.</li>
</ul>

target="_blank">Climate Impact Explorer.</a></p>
<p>In these scenarios the total cumulative relative GDP impact is
estimated to be between -1.5% and-2.5% by 2050. World GDP losses from
physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over
time. GDP impacts from transition risk are slightly positive in the Net
Zero 2050 scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon
prices and energy costs are more than offset by the recycling of carbon
tax revenues into government investment and lower employment taxes.</p>

<p>Overall, these are relatively optimistic scenarios as both transition
and physical risks are limited. Any policies that are either introduced
or changed are assumed to take place efficiently with little variation
between countries and sectors. Similarly, the development and deployment
of alternative technologies are expected to take place without
significant difficulty. For example, the availability of Carbon dioxide
removal technologies which involves removing carbon from the atmosphere
through increasing forest cover and soil sequestration or growing crops
for bioenergy doesn’t pose a significant challenge in either orderly
scenario.</p>

<div id="agriculture-sector" class="section level1">
<h1>Agriculture Sector</h1>
<p>The <strong>Agriculture</strong> sector can be split into crop
production and animal production.</p>
<p>Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for
food and fibre. This subsector comprises establishments such as farms,
orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in
growing crops, plants, vines, or trees and their seeds. The industries
in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, the
length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, extent of input
specialization, labour requirements and capital demands.</p>
<p>The production process is typically completed when the raw product or
commodity grown reaches the “farm gate” for market, that is, at the
point of first sale or price determination. Within the subsector, the
NAICS classifies establishments to a specific industry when a product or
industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, vegetable
and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or
more of the establishment’s agricultural production.</p>
<p>Industries in the Animal Production, Fishing and Aquaculture
subsector raise or fatten animals for the sale of animals or animal
products and/or raise aquatic plants and animals in controlled or
selected aquatic environments for the sale of aquatic plants, animals,
or their products. The subsector includes establishments, such as
ranches, farms, and feedlots primarily engaged in keeping, grazing,
breeding, or feeding animals. These animals are kept for the products
they produce or for eventual sale. The industries in this subsector are
grouped by important factors, such as suitable grazing or pastureland,
specialized buildings, type of equipment and the amount and types of
labour required.</p>
<p>Establishments are classified to the Animal Production, Fishing and
Aquaculture subsector when animal production (i.e., value of animals for
market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment’s total
agricultural production.</p>

<h4>Agriculture Sector — Orderly transition — Summary</h4>
<p>The Agriculture sector continues to expand to feed and supply
agricultural energy products to a growing global population. It
contributes to 23% of anthropogenic emissions, exposing its producers
and financiers to emerging climate related transition risks through
public policies, consumer demand shifts and technological
evolutions.</p>
<p>By 2050, the Orderly transition risk scenarios driven by societal
change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely
to have a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Agricultural
value chains face material climate transition risk exposure due to their
emissions intensity and reliance on land. A potential expansion of land

forests could reduce land available for agriculture.</p>
<p>These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in

for the agriculture sector, although the impact is likely to be limited
due to inelastic demand for food products.</p>

<div id="agriculture-sector-orderly-transition-details"
class="section level4">
<h4>Agriculture Sector — Orderly transition — Details</h4>
<p>The changes in food and bioenergy demand, emission pricing or taxes,
consumer preferences and land use restrictions could potentially result
in one or more of the following financial impacts, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Revenue growth</strong> in line with global demand and
commodity prices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rising production costs</strong> due to higher input
costs and GHG emissions costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in capital expenditures</strong> as farms need
to invest in research and development and deployment of new technologies
and farming approaches necessary for long-term productivity
growth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More write-offs of assets</strong> as expansion of land
protection policies to preserve and expand forests could reduce land
available for agriculture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but face
greater risks of stranded assets, geographic growth constraints, and
rising production costs in the face of new emissions costs, land use
restrictions, and necessary productivity improvements.</p>
<p>The sector has very high GHG emissions as farm and livestock
productions and activities are emissions intensive. The total demand
could continue to increase in the Orderly transition risk scenarios,
however growth in demand for food production is limited.</p>

<p>As the use of bioenergy increases, by 2050, approx. 30% of total
agricultural production in the Net Zero 2050 scenario and around 12% in
the Below 2°C scenario could be consumed for energy generation.</p>

<p>Agricultural sector is key driver of forest loss, and due to forest
conservation and preservation policies, availability of agricultural
land reduces, limiting the growth of agricultural land cover. However,
technological innovations in yields and productivity increase land use
efficiency, allowing agriculture production to continue to increase with
the rising demand of food and energy due to population growth. By 2050,
agricultural land could increase by around 60 to 100 million hectares
and forest cover could increase by around 160 million hectares in the
Net Zero 2050 scenario and could remain unchanged in the Below 2°C
scenario.</p>

<p>The operational and production costs of firms could increase as they
need to make necessary investments for technological upgrades and due to
increases in carbon taxes. But producers should be able to pass the
higher input costs to consumers due to inelastic demand of food and
increasing usage of clean bioenergy and biofuels.</p>
<p>Despite these material risks, agricultural companies and investors
can also derive significant opportunities from climate transitions. By
investing in sustainable intensification, regenerative agriculture, and
diversifying revenue streams, forward-looking agricultural companies
could see their net value and profitability rise under transitions.</p>

in already arid regions, such as North Africa, may have a negative
impact on production, whereas production in colder and wetter areas,
such as Northern and Western regions in the UK, may benefit from warm
conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acute Impacts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Changing rainfall patterns</strong>, reduced availability
of water for irrigation could threaten agricultural production,
particularly in areas where water supplies are already under pressure.
Drier soil conditions could reduce growth of crops, pasture and trees.
Extended or repeated period of droughts may cause death of younger tress
reducing forest productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased frequency and intensity of Wildfires, Cyclones
or Storms</strong> could cause significant damage to forests and
disrupts the natural ecosystems that has been developed around the
forests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Physical risks could affect the range and quality of the ecosystem
services that agriculture and forestry not only provide, but also rely
on. These include climate control, flood regulation, biodiversity,
pollination and nutrient cycling. The agriculture and forestry sectors
have already adapted to change by introducing new genotypes, varieties,
breeds and management practices. In a low physical risk scenario, there
could be a need for more anticipatory adaptation measures.</p>

<p>The NGFS have provided two Disorderly scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Divergent Net Zero</strong> reaches Net Zero globally
around 2050 but with higher costs in the short-term due to divergent
policies being adopted across sectors leading to inefficiencies and a
quicker phase out of oil use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delayed transition</strong> assumes annual emissions do
not decrease until 2030. Strong policies are needed to limit warming to
below 2°C by 2050. CO<sub>2</sub> removal is limited.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="key-assumptions-and-parameters-1"

<h3 class="unlisted unnumbered">Key assumptions and parameters</h3>
<p>In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action enables a
“fossil recovery” out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19,
which results in emissions increasing until 2030. Policies drive a sharp
decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate for the
inaction beforehand. In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to occur earlier and as a result is more
gradual.</p>

<p>In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction enables a
“fossil recovery” out of the economic crisis, which delays the increase
of carbon prices until 2030, compared to the Divergent Net Zero scenario
where carbon prices rise at a smoother rate because while there are
varied policies implemented across countries and sectors these measures
have been put in place earlier. In both the scenarios disorderly policy
action results in transition risk.</p>

<p>The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are
projected to increase in Disorderly transition risk scenarios. These are
expected to be higher in a Divergent compared to a Delayed scenario.
Overall, firms could be required to readjust their capital expenditure
in line with these trends; developing more efficient and less carbon
intensive products and services in order to adhere to carbon pricing
policies. The technologies that result from these investments could also
adjust asset valuations of relatively older technology. Annual
investment in energy efficiency increases from around 200 billion USD
(inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between 600 billion USD and 850
billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon increases
from ~750 billion USD to ~3 trillion USD by 2050.</p>

<p>Observed climate change has already increased global mean
temperatures above 1.2°C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both
the global land area and the global population annually exposed to river
flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves has
already more than doubled (See Kaufman, D. et al. (2020).). The
increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide
in the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years
and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming
since the mid-20th century. In these scenarios global mean temperatures
are projected to increase across the world by 1.6°C to 1.8°C, above
pre-industrial levels, by 2050 (with land warming faster than oceans and
high latitudes experiencing higher warming) giving rise to low physical
risk.</p>

<p>These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions
affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and
sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of
weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and
flooding. For example, in the delayed transition risk scenario we could
see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the
human body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate
conditions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to
increase, peaking at a ~140% over a 1986-2006 reference period around
2035, and remaining around this level thereafter. Annual economic
damages from cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser
extent; peaking at ~20% above reference period levels around 2050.</li>

<p>In these scenarios the total cumulative relative GDP impact is
estimated to be between -4.2% and -4.8% by 2050. World GDP losses from
physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over
time. World GDP impacts from Disorderly transition risks are negative as
the speed of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and
affects consumption and investment. In these scenarios, there is a large
mix of physical and transition risks in 2050.</p>

<p>Overall, the Delayed transition scenario leaves a limited timeframe
for countries, companies and the population to adapt to climate change.
The Divergent Net Zero scenario will imply a higher cost to reach Net
Zero by 2050 due to divergent policies.</p>

<h1>Agriculture Sector</h1>
<p>The <strong>Agriculture</strong> sector can be split into crop
production and animal production.</p>
<p>Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for
food and fibre. This subsector comprises establishments such as farms,
orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in
growing crops, plants, vines, or trees and their seeds. The industries
in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, the
length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, extent of input
specialization, labour requirements and capital demands.</p>
<p>The production process is typically completed when the raw product or
commodity grown reaches the “farm gate” for market, that is, at the
point of first sale or price determination. Within the subsector, the
NAICS classifies establishments to a specific industry when a product or
industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, vegetable
and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or
more of the establishment’s agricultural production.</p>
<p>Industries in the Animal Production, Fishing and Aquaculture
subsector raise or fatten animals for the sale of animals or animal
products and/or raise aquatic plants and animals in controlled or
selected aquatic environments for the sale of aquatic plants, animals,
or their products. The subsector includes establishments, such as
ranches, farms, and feedlots primarily engaged in keeping, grazing,
breeding, or feeding animals. These animals are kept for the products
they produce or for eventual sale. The industries in this subsector are
grouped by important factors, such as suitable grazing or pastureland,
specialized buildings, type of equipment and the amount and types of

agricultural production.</p>
<div id="agriculture-sector-disorderly-transition-summary"
class="section level4">
<h4>Agriculture Sector — Disorderly transition — Summary</h4>
<p>The Agriculture sector continues to expand to feed and supply
agricultural energy products to a growing global population. It
contributes to 23% of anthropogenic emissions, exposing its producers
and financiers to emerging climate related transition risks through
public policies, consumer demand shifts and technological
evolutions.</p>
<p>By 2050, in the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action
enables a “fossil recovery” out of the economic crisis brought about by
COVID-19. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030, before sharply
decreasing after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the
Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent reduction in
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. These scenarios are likely to have a
significant impact on agriculture sector. Agricultural value chains face
material climate transition risk exposure due to their emissions
intensity and reliance on land. Under these scenarios, the expansion of
land protection policies and carbon payments made to preserve and expand
forests could reduce land available for agriculture.</p>
<p>These scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This
could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the
agriculture sector, although the impact is likely to be limited due to
inelastic demand for food products.</p>
</div>
<div id="agriculture-sector-disorderly-transition-details"
class="section level4">
<h4>Agriculture Sector — Disorderly transition — Details</h4>
<p>The changes in food and bioenergy demand, emission pricing or taxes,
consumer preferences and land use restrictions could potentially result
in one or more of the following financial impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Revenue growth</strong> due to rising global demand and
commodity prices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rising production costs</strong> due to higher input
costs and GHG emissions costs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in capital expenditures</strong> as farms need
to invest in research and development and deployment of new technologies
necessary for long-term productivity growth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More write-offs of assets</strong> as expansion of land
protection policies to preserve and expand forests could reduce land
available for agriculture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but face
greater risks of stranded assets, geographic growth constraints, and
rising production costs in the face of new emissions costs, land use
restrictions, and necessary productivity improvements.</p>
<p>The sector has very high GHG emissions as farm and livestock
productions and activities are emission intensive. The total demand
could continue to increase in the Disorderly transition risk scenarios,
however growth in demand for food production is limited.</p>

<p>As the use of bioenergy increases, by 2050, just over 40% of total
agricultural production (in both Delayed Transition and Divergent Net
Zero scenarios) are consumed for energy generation.</p>

<p>Agricultural sector is key driver of forest loss, and due to forest
conservation and preservation policies, availability of agricultural
land reduces, limiting the growth of agricultural land cover. However,
technological innovations in yields and productivity increase land use
efficiency, allowing agriculture production to continue to increase with
the rising demand of food and energy due to population growth. By 2050,
agricultural land could increase by around 45 to 70 million hectares and
forest cover could increase by around 160 million hectares.</p>

<p>The operational and production costs of firms could increase as they
need to make necessary investments for technological upgrades and
increase in carbon taxes. But producers should be able to pass the
higher input costs to consumers due to inelastic demand of food and
increasing usage of clean bioenergy and biofuels.</p>
<p>Despite these material risks, agricultural companies and investors
can also derive significant opportunities from climate transitions. By
investing in sustainable intensification, regenerative agriculture, and
diversifying revenue streams, forward-looking agricultural companies
could see their net value and profitability rise under transitions.</p>
</div>
<div id="agriculture-sector-low-physical-risk-summary-1"
class="section level4">
<h4>Agriculture Sector — Low physical risk — Summary</h4>
<p>The Agriculture sector is also exposed to physical risk. Chronic
effects (e.g. raised sea-levels and mean temperatures) and acute effects
due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as
heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding are adding to pressures on
global agricultural and food systems and could lead to severe disruption
to agricultural production which could impact the profitability for some
companies in long-run.</p>
<p>In the low physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming
could increase weather variations. This could lead to increasing
disruption to agriculture sector which could impact profitability.</p>
</div>
<div id="agriculture-sector-low-physical-risk-details-1"
class="section level4">
<h4>Agriculture Sector — Low physical risk — Details</h4>
<p>The following examples illustrate how the agriculture sector could be
impacted in a low physical risk scenario:</p>
<p><strong>Chronic Impacts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increase in sea-level rise and flooding</strong>, may
lead to substantial losses in crop and livestock production in low-lying
agricultural areas and may contribute to waterlogging and soil erosion.
Wetter weather could threaten agricultural production by adversely
affecting crop yields.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Higher average temperatures</strong> could have an impact
on production, this could vary across the regions. Warmer, drier climate
in already arid regions, such as North Africa, may have a negative
impact on production, whereas production in colder and wetter areas,
such as Northern and Western regions in the UK, may benefit from warm
conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acute Impacts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Changing rainfall patterns</strong>, reduced availability
of water for irrigation could threaten agricultural production,
particularly in areas where water supplies are already under pressure.
Drier soil conditions could reduce growth of crops, pasture and trees.
Extended or repeated period of droughts may cause death of younger tress
reducing forest productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased frequency and intensity of Wildfires, Cyclones
or Storms</strong> could cause significant damage to forests and
disrupts the natural ecosystems that has been developed around the
forests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Physical risks could affect the range and quality of the ecosystem
services that agriculture and forestry not only provide, but also rely
on. These include climate control, flood regulation, biodiversity,
pollination and nutrient cycling. The agriculture and forestry sectors
have already adapted to change by introducing new genotypes, varieties,
breeds and management practices. In a low physical risk scenario, there
could be a need for more anticipatory adaptation measures.</p>

<p>Carbon price is a measure of overall policy intensity. Emission

<h4>Agriculture Sector — High physical risk — Summary</h4>
<p>The Agriculture sector is also exposed to physical risk. Chronic

due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as
heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding are adding to pressures on
global agricultural and food systems and could lead to severe disruption
to agricultural production which could impact the profitability for some
companies in long-run. Whilst the agriculture sector is used to
responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high
physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming could increase
weather variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to
agriculture sector which could impact profitability.</p>
<p>Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to
a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for
agriculture, although the impact is likely to be limited due to
inelastic demand for food products.</p>

<h4>Agriculture Sector — High physical risk — Details</h4>
<p>The following examples illustrate how the Agriculture sector could be
impacted in a high physical risk scenario:</p>
<p><strong>Chronic Impacts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increase in sea-level rise</strong>, may lead to
substantial losses in crop and livestock production in low-lying
agricultural areas and may contribute to waterlogging and soil erosion.
Wetter weather could threaten agricultural production by adversely
affecting crop yields.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Higher average temperatures</strong> could have an impact
on production, this could vary across the regions. Warmer, drier
climates in tropical regions may have a negative impact on production
where production in colder and wetter areas may benefit from warm
conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acute Impacts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Changing rainfall patterns</strong>, reduced availability
of water for irrigation could threaten agricultural production,
particularly in areas where water supplies are already under pressure.
Drier soil conditions could reduce growth of crops, pasture and trees.
Extended or repeated period of droughts may cause death of younger tress
reducing forest productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased frequency and intensity of Wildfires, Cyclones
or Storms</strong> could cause significant damage to forests and
disrupts the natural ecosystems that has been developed around the
forests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Significantly slowed GDP growth could impact demand for agriculture
through its effect on individuals’ disposable income. The impact on food
products is likely to be low due to inelastic demand, but demand for
bioenergy could see growth partially offset.</p>
<p>Physical risks could affect the range and quality of the ecosystem
services that agriculture and forestry not only provide, but also rely
on. These include climate control, flood regulation, biodiversity,
pollination and nutrient cycling. The agriculture and forestry sectors
have already adapted to change by introducing new genotypes, varieties,
breeds and management practices. In a high physical risk scenario, there
could be a need for more anticipatory adaptation measures.</p>
