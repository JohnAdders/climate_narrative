name: Commercial Property

description: 
    The sector of commercial property is likely to be affected by both transition and physical risks.
transition:
    high:
        always: &transition
            The property sector will be challenged to improve energy efficiency of buildings.
            For the new construction this probably means 'Net zero buildings'.
            Lower carbon intensity construction technology investments are necessary.


            But due to long period of property use (and inherent inertia) changes to existing
            buildings may prove even more important.
            Energy efficiency can be improved (e.g. insulation, triple glazing,
            efficient heating/cooling, use of renewable energy), it may prove costly or unpractical
            in some cases. As a result, some of the older buildings that fail to meet the standards
            may become practically unusable and lose its economic value.

        high_materiality: &transition_high
            Property is a high materiality sector for your company. Therefore it is recommended
            to proactively cooperate with the companies to find the optimal transition pathway
            in advance, before it is enforced by law.
    low:
        always: *transition
        high_materiality: *transition_high
physical:
    high:
        always: &physical
            The property sector is likely to be one of the most adversely affected by the physical risk.
            The existing buildings cannot be moved and will be directly exposed to both chronic
            (changing long term climate conditions, leading to e.g. increased cooling capacity required)
            and acute symptoms (including droughts and floods)
        high_materiality: &physical_high
            Property is a high materiality sector for your company. Therefore it is recommended
            to proactively cooperate with the companies to identify and (where possible and practical)
            mitigate the possible physical risk to the existing buildings.
