name: Financial Services

description: "
    The **Financial Services** sector covers a broad range of business that provide a variety of economic services, such as investing, managing and lending money, insurance and capital and debt markets.  Central banking, also part of this sector, is outside the scope of this tool. More formally, the Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector covers business that 
    
    
    -	lend funds, which might be raised from depositors, credit market borrowing or by borrowing from other financial intermediaries. This covers firms like banks and building societies.
    
    
    -	facilitate the lending of funds or issuance of credit by engaging in such activities as mortgage and loan brokerage, clearinghouse and reserve services, and check cashing services.
    
    
    Firms in the Securities, Commodity Contracts, and Other Financial Investments subsector are primarily engaged in one of the following: 
    
    
    -	underwriting securities issues and/or making markets for securities and commodities
    
    
    -	acting as agents (i.e., brokers) between buyers and sellers of securities and commodities
    
    
    -	providing securities and commodity exchange services; and 
    
    
    -	providing other services, such as managing portfolios of assets; providing investment advice; and trust, fiduciary, and custody services.
    
    
    Insurance companies underwrite annuities and provide insurance policies. Industries in the Funds, Trusts, and Other Financial Vehicles subsector are comprised of legal entities that pool securities or other assets on behalf of shareholders or beneficiaries of employee benefit or other trust funds. 
    
    
    Broadly speaking, institutions with balance sheets, such as banks, building societies, insurance companies, will be exposed to the extent that they lend to/underwrite/accept deposits from/trade with counterparties who are themselves exposed to transition or physical risk. Asset managers, who manage funds on behalf of others, will not have the same balance sheet risks.  Instead, the main financial risk for their business arises from the assets they are managing on behalf of their clients (in portfolios or funds).

            The risks from climate change will largely depend on the business model of the financial firm and the regions in which it operates. Because they have relatively low greenhouse gas emissions, the main financial risk for most financial institutions is from the impact of transition (and physical) risks on their counterparties (that is, firms they lend to, invest in and/or insure such as corporates and households) and/or the assets they manage. 
            
            
            Where the increases in carbon and energy prices in a disorderly transition risk scenario could potentially result in financial impacts; the extent will depend on the industries/sectors of financial firms underlying exposures. The disorderly transition risk scenario can affect real financial asset valuations significantly, with considerable regional differences. Sectors with high emissions are arguably most exposed to transition risk. 
            
            
            To determine the nature of the transition risks for financial firms, it is necessary to examine the industries/sectors of their underlying exposures. In a disorderly transition risk scenario, we expect to see a sharp change in regulation, laws, consumer behaviour and/or technological development. Sectors that are most vulnerable to this sudden change will tend to be in the carbon intensive sectors or have limited ability to pass price increases to customers. Hence, concentrations of lending or underwriting to these sectors will be more highly exposed.

            Material exposures for financial institutions in disorderly transition risk scenarios will tend to occur where there are concentrations of lending, insurance underwriting, asset management and/or trading to 
            
            
            (i)	industries or companies that are carbon intensive (e.g. Transport, Buildings Materials, Industrials), 
            
            
            (ii)	industries where it is hard to pass cost increases onto customers, and 
            
            
            (iii)	companies that have a narrow range of products that will be phased out (e.g. a manufacturing company whose sole customer base is thermal coal mines). 
            
            
            Financial firms investing in climate solutions, for example, renewable energy, green hydrogen, battery electric vehicles, and carbon capture and storage (technologies and market set to grow in a disorderly transition scenario) or investing in companies with ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon emissions across the value chain in line with the Paris Agreement should be less exposed to transition risk than financial firms investing in companies with carbon intensive activities with little or no ambition to change (current and future carbon emissions misaligned with the Paris Agreement). Financial firms exposure to transition risks also depends on their geographical and business mix (including jurisdictions most exposed to carbon policy risks and technologies which are the most threatened by the transition, for example, Internal Combustion Engines in the Automobile sector). 
            
            
            Firms will need to identity whether their portfolio has exposures to these types of industries and engage with these counterparties to aid their transition to a low carbon economy or, where this is not possible (e.g. when the portfolio must be adjusted quickly), divest. Failure to do this could result in further transition risks, such as a reduced social licence to operate as the firm suffers reputational damage. Asset managers must also consider reputational transition risks and avoid leakage by ensuring their repriced carbon intensive assets are retired or modified, rather than sold on and used elsewhere.

            To determine the nature of physical risks requires information on the geographic location of assets. Assessing the risks to these assets requires insights on the vulnerability (for example, how reliant is the asset on climate sensitive supplies?), the likelihood of a damage event (e.g. flooding or heat-related failures), and the exposure (i.e. the amount invested in that location). A high physical risk scenario will be associated with chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. Financial firms will need to consider how to adapt their physical operations to ensure the safety of their staff and more general business continuity concerns. But their main financial fisk will arise from the impact on their counterparties, which will be largely a function of their geographic location.

            All financial institutions with physical operations, such as offices, data centres, branch networks, will be exposed to physical risks. This will tend to occur where there are concentrations of lending, insurance underwriting, asset management and/or trading in geographies that will be affected by any of the different climate changes and will depend on their location. The following examples illustrate how financial institutions could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
            
            
            **Acute Impacts**
            
            
            * **Cyclones or storms** are likely to have a significant effect on many different types of industries. 
            
            
            * **Coastal and river flooding**.  Rising sea levels and changes in precipitation patterns could pose flooding risks to many sectors.
            
            
            There will be direct impacts on counterparties, impacting residential and commercial real estate, potentially reducing the value of those properties that are held as collateral against loans, thereby increasing loss given default if the customer is not able to repay the loan. Non-life insurance companies losses will increase, meaning that premiums will need to be increased to maintain margins.  The insurance market already devotes much resource to acute impacts e.g. flood modelling and flood mapping, as a key weather peril. Different insurance entities will have different areas of focus, depending on the size, risk profile, business mix etc. 
            
            
            **Chronic Impacts**
            
            
            * **Drought** could lead to greater competition between companies as they fight for scarce water resources. It will also likely lead to an expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting water supply and quality. This would incur hefty additional costs for water using industries.
            
            
            * **Temperature** increases in some regions will be substantial, affecting everything from agriculture, to transport, to medical care.
            
            
            In high physical risk scenarios, it may be that certain risks become uninsurable. That will have knock on consequences for other companies in the financial system. Counterparties supply chains may also be vulnerable to physical impacts, affecting their sales, profit and loss, and balance sheets. Firms will need to identity whether their portfolio has exposures to these types of climate impacts. Firms will need to assess the extent to which there are local defences, which reduce the risk.
