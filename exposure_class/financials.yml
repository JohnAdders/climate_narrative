transition:
    high:
        always:
            There may be significant indirect exposure to transition risk (e.g. if an institution
            provides capital to carbon intensive sectors, which will be significantly affected).



            Apart from the indirect exposure to transition risk, there is a direct exposure as well.
            The financial companies need to monitor the situation, consider climate related
            metrics in their business decision and disclose the relevant metrics. This will likely
            be analysed by their investors and counterparties. In the disorderly transition
            this may prove challenging.
        high_materiality:
            As the exposure to financial sector is highly material, it is worth
            to analyse the exposure on look through basis, using the available reports
            from the companies to assess their resilience to transition risk.

    low:
        always:
            Apart from the indirect exposure to transition risk, there is a direct exposure as well.
            The financial companies need to monitor the situation, consider climate related

            be analysed by their investors and counterparties.
            The process of transition will be relatively smooth, allowing the management of the financial
            companies to avoid much of the large unexpected losses.
        high_materiality:
            Even for high materiality exposure to the financial sector the impact should not
            threaten your company
            (unless the portfolio is skewed towards specific, vulnerable exposures).
    

physical:
    high:
        always:
            The sector is expected to be largely affected, but mostly in an indirect way. The extent
            may vary considerably depending on the climate policy of the particular company.
        high_materiality:
            As the exposure to financial sector is highly material, it is worth
            to analyse the exposure on look through basis, using the available reports
            from the companies to assess their resilience to physical risk.
    low:
        always:
            The sector is expected to be affected to some extent,mostly in an indirect way.
            The extent may vary depending on the climate policy of the particular company.
        high_materiality:
            Even for high materiality exposure to the financial sector the impact should not
            threaten your company
            (unless the portfolio is skewed towards specific, vulnerable exposures).
