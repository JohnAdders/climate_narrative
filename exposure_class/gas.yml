name: Oil and gas

description: 
    The oil and gas sector are essential for current economy, but are unsustainable in its current shape
    if the carbon emissions are to be massively reduced.
transition:
    high:
        always:
            The transition to low carbon economy threatens the very existence of the companies focusing
            on oil and/or gas. In the disorderly transition the companies will likely be severely hit.    
        high_materiality:
            High materiality exposure to this sector makes your company heavily exposed to the
            transition risk as well.
        bond_like:
            Debt issued by oil and gas companies may default.
    low:
        always:
            The transition to low carbon economy threatens the very existence of the companies focusing
            on oil and/or gas. Some possibilities of management actions however do exist, including


            + fugitive emissions capture technology,

            + energy efficiency,
            
            + fuel switching (hydrogen)
            
            
            It has to be noted that gas is relatively less carbon intensive than other carbon fuels,
            therefore in shorter term transition may even be an opportunity to gas related companies.
        high_materiality:
            High materiality exposure to this sector makes your company heavily exposed to the
            transition risk as well.
physical:
    high:
        always:
            The physical risk is not expected to affect the sector in a particular way.
        high_materiality:
            Note that this is a high materiality sector for your company.
