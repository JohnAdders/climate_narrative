            The transportation sector is a major source of emission and is likely to be
            heavily affected in the global transition towards low carbon economy.


            As for road transport, some countries already announced future ban on
            vehicles powered with combustion engines.
            This is currently a challenge for the industry as electric vehicles
            are still much more expensive to produce and not so convenient to the users.
            Another possibility is use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel, but the technology
            is even further to being able to comercially replace fuels based on crude oil.


            It is not only road transport that will be affected, in a similar manner the
            transition affects ships and airplanes. In those cases the technology is even
            less developed for now and it will be more technologically challenging to
            cut the emissions proportionally.


            It must be noted that the transition may create new opportunities for the rail
            transport. This is probably the lowest carbon option among currently (widely) used
            means of transport, provided that the electricity comes from clean sources.
            
            
            As in any industry, the transition will affect the whole value chain, not only
            car manufacturers and their suppliers but also companies offering transport
            of goods and passengers.
