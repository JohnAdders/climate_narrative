name: Oil and gas

description: |
  The **oil and gas sector** comprises three main activities - upstream
  (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and processing) and
  downstream (distribution and sale to end users/consumers). This sector
  includes companies that are, for example, involved in the following:

  - the exploration, development and/or the production of natural gas from wells
    in which the hydrocarbons will initially flow or can be produced using
    normal or enhanced drilling and extraction techniques

  - the production of crude petroleum from reservoirs in which the hydrocarbons
    are semisolids

  - the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from oil and gas field gases.

  - manufacturing machinery and equipment for the use in the oil and gas sector
    or for drilling water wells, including portable drilling rigs.

  - producing gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils and residual fuel oils
    through refraction or straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation,
    cracking or other processes.

  - transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas for sale

  - operating oil and gas wells as well as those engaged in providing support
    services.

    always: |
      By 2050, in Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, fossil fuels
      represent only ~23% of global energy demand compared to ~83% in 2020.
      Carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the
      most vulnerable to transition. In a delayed transition scenario, a fossil
      fuelled recovery out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19,
      results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030, before
      decreasing sharply afterwards to compensate for the inaction to that date,
      whereas in the divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent
      reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

      While oil and gas will continue to play a role in meeting global energy
      demand in the short- and medium-term, the changing patterns in energy
      consumption, driven by societal change, national energy strategies, and
      carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and long-term impact
      on demand for oil and gas, affecting profitability in both scenarios.

      The Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios could also lead to a
      reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of
      growth in demand for the oil and gas sector.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy prices can
      result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Reduced revenue** due to decline in fossil fuel demand as consumers
        switch to low-carbon/electrified alternatives for cars, heating etc;
        this will impact business models, including service providers who derive
        revenue from the oil and gas industry.

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions via tax or
        cap & trade clearing programs

      - **Readjusted capital expenditures** focusing on new investments required
        to pivot business model towards low-carbon fuels, renewable biofuels
        and/or CCUS

      - **Rapidly falling asset values** of oil and gas reserves and
        infrastructure required for extraction, based on re-adjusted
        expectations of much lower demand for fossil fuels in future

      In Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, the oil and gas sector
      is likely to be significantly impacted. Driven by increased
      electrification, total electricity capacity and generation jumps markedly,
      and the underlying sources change dramatically. Solar is the dominant
      technology representing around half of electricity generation capacity by
      2050, completely displacing coal (before 2030) and gas (between 2030 and
      2035).

      Demand for oil and gas decreases rapidly as the share of renewables in the
      electricity generation mix increases to almost 70% by 2050.

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) remain
      depressed throughout the scenario horizon, while secondary energy prices
      (i.e. paid by large scale consumers) rise in line with the carbon price.

      Under Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, belated awareness by
      financial market participants of the scale and speed of the transition
      required may cause fossil fuel assets to undergo a fire-sale by investors,
      at the moment when they fully understand the real risk involved in holding
      these in their portfolios.

      Because the oil and gas sector is so diverse, there is no single solution,
      but rather a range of strategies based on the circumstances of each
      company that will need to be deployed in Disorderly/Divergent transition
      risk scenario to maintain revenues and minimise the long-term financial
      impact. Examples include transitioning to become an integrated energy
      company providing renewable power generation or investing in carbon
      capture and storage (CCS) technologies.

      Overall, demand for oil and gas decreases steadily as the share of
      renewables in the electricity generation mix increases. This is driven by
      the fact that the share of electric vehicles on the roads steadily
      increases and a large share of the remaining conventional vehicles use
      biofuels instead of petrol or diesel.

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) remain
      above 2020 levels but secondary energy prices (i.e. paid by large scale
      consumers) rise as the increased operating costs from paying a price on
      carbon emissions is partially passed to downstream consumers.

      By 2050, renewables and biomass would cover around three quarters of
      global primary energy needs, driving stranding of fossil fuel assets.

physical:
  high:
    always: |
      The oil and gas sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of
      climate change including both the chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels)
      and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather
      events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones and
      flooding. Whilst the oil and gas industry is used to responding to and
      managing changing weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario,
      climate change and global warming will increase weather variations. This
      could lead to increasing disruption to oil and gas production which could
      impact the profitability for these companies.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
      over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for oil and
      gas.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the oil and gas sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Rising sea levels** could cause frequent disruption to coastal oil
        refineries and potentially could cause closures especially when
        compounded with storm surge events, such as those generated by tropical
        cyclones. For example, hurricane Katrina caused the total shutdown of
        oil production in the Gulf of Mexico for 6 months.

      - **Water stress/long-term drought** could lead to greater competition
        between oil and gas companies as they fight for scarce water resources.
        It will also likely lead to an expectation of increased environmental
        regulation focusing on protecting water supply and quality. This would
        incur hefty additional costs for water intensive industries. As methane
        is highly flammable, gas vented from leaks in compressors or pipelines
        can be ignited by sparks or embers from bushfires leading to devastating
        wildfires.

      - **Thawing permafrost** could lead to widespread regions of pipeline
        subsidence, causing damage and increased maintenance costs. New pipeline
        construction costs could also increase due to building on unstable
        ground.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Tropical Cyclones** are likely to have a significant effect on
        construction, offshore production, onshore processing and decommission
        phases of oil and gas projects resulting from major disruptions as well
        as significant damage to facilities. Extreme conditions from major
        storms would lead to large spills/leaks resulting in significant
        clean-up costs. Increased frequency of tropical cyclones could also lead
        to successive events leading to delays in return to business as usual.

      - **Flood** could pose serious risks to the oil and gas sector such as
        significant damage to facilities and refineries, loss of production, and
        increasing risks of dispersal of salt and chemicals from coal seam gas
        mines onto farming land.

      Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for oil and
      gas through its effect on individuals disposable income.

      There are many mitigating actions companies can take against the physical
      risks mentioned above. For example, investing in more resilient offshore
      rigs, improved drainage systems and better equipment to be able to
      withstand stronger cyclones, a more robust design of infrastructure and
      stricter construction standards. To reduce the impact of rising sea
      levels, the position of new facilities should consider climate change to
      minimise the risk of total damage caused by flooding.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Tropical Cyclones** could have an effect on the construction, offshore
        production, onshore processing and decommission phases of oil and gas
        projects resulting from either short-term disruption or damage to
        facilities. These conditions could also lead to spills/leaks resulting
        in additional clean-up costs.
