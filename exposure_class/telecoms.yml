name: Telecommunications

description: "
    The **telecommunication** (telecom) sector comprises companies that provide telecommunications and services related to that activity (e.g. telephony, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP); cable and satellite television distribution services; Internet access; telecommunications reselling services). This sector is also engaged in operating, and/or providing access to facilities for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies. 
    
    
    This industry also comprises firms that are primarily engaged in:
    
    
    1.	purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless telecommunications services (except satellite) to businesses and households
    
    
    2.	providing specialised telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation
    
    
    3.	providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems; or 
    
    
    4.	providing Internet access services or Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services via client-supplied telecommunications connections.

            While telecoms will continue to play a role in meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation, driven by divergent or late policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely to have an impact on this sector, affecting profitability and consumer preferences.
            
            
            * **Increased operating costs**, the increases in carbon and energy prices could potentially result in financial impacts, as firms’ carbon emissions face a rising price in the form a carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price, particularly for copper and other lightweight materials commonly found in phones/ cables and network sites.
            
            
            * **Asset valuation of company reserves will have to be re-priced** based on the re-adjusted expectations of the use of low-carbon products and energy efficient technologies in the future. Failure to provide low carbon emissions in telecom material will affect the commercial reputation of the company and could lead to loss in customers and decrease in revenue.
            
            
            * **Changing consumer preferences**, these could lead to changes in sales due to new/lost customers as a result of change in environmental performance

            Where the increases carbon and energy prices in the high transition risk scenario
            can drive the financial impacts for the telecom companies; these will depend on:
            How reliant is the company's production/revenue mix on low carbon electricity?
            What is the client's 'temperature alignment' score and how does this compare
            to the sector average?
            
            
            The profitability of this sector will also depend on the relevant companies proactively
            investing in innovation and new technology and their ability to mitigate transition risks.
            For example:
            
            
            * invest in and roll out energy efficient technologies e.g. 5G & Fibre (balanced with expanding use cases driving energy consumption up), 
            
            
            * use electric vehicles for engineering truck fleets;
            
            
            *switch to 100% renewables and green power purchase agreements (PPAs)  for fixed and mobile networks;
            
            
            * develop on site energy generation and sustainable energy sourcing (offsite PPAs)
            
            
            *use natural resources more efficiently
            
            
            *use Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to better forecast network energy demands and measure consumption. The uses and new capabilities are adding to these technologies and are growing in year on yearyear-on-year basis;
            
            
            * improve device battery technologies and packaging reduction;
            
            
            * embed sustainable supply chain & partnership strategy; 
            
            
            * use ‘Smart’ network components which shutdown/start up in line with demand and usage;
            
            
            * integrate E-Waste circular economy and smart recycling into consumer propositions (e.g. o2 Recycle).
            
            
            *use ‘Green Steel’ in construction of telecoms infrastructure
            
            
            * Develop technology to foster, or directly work on, solutions that minimise need for travel (e.g. BT’s Remote Diagnostic Station)
            
            
            These actions could also lead to gain positive commercial reputation and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers will proactively shop at businesses with an incorporated green strategy.

            The telecom sector is also exposed to physical risk. Chronic and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as flooding, high winds, fire and extreme temperatures could cause significant network damage or service impacts. Whilst the telecom industry is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming will increase weather variations. This will lead to increasing disruption to productivity in this sector which could significantly impact the profitability and the infrastructure for these companies and could therefore result an increase in the operational cost (as operations become largely reactive to remediate issues), impact employment and potentially lead to a significant decline in revenue due to inability to operate and meet customer demands

        high_materiality: "
            The following examples illustrate how the telecom sector could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
            
            
            * **Flooding events** could pose risks to the telecom sector such as damage to infrastructure e.g. damage to facilities, water ingress and flooding of exchange buildings, base stations, cable ducts and chambers due to high rainfall and flooding. Marvell Technology Group Ltd., a company which makes network components for smartphones, has had their assets damaged by flooding.
            
            
            * Overhead access network, backhaul, and core network via poles and pylons at risk of damage by **severe winds**.
            
            
            * The increase in **wildfires** frequency and severity could also increase damage to infrastructure.
            
            
            * **Increase in precipitation** leading to interruption to or reduction in quality of wireless service, and an increase in frequency or severity of damage to low-lying infrastructure, access holes, transport structures & underground facilities. For example, Vodafone had disruptions to their services after one of their data centres flooded.
            
            
            * Loss of power to the network if the national grid is impacted by weather causes operational disruption
            
            
            * **Extreme temperatures** causing overheating of equipment in base stations or street cabinets

            
            There are a number of mitigating actions these companies can take against the high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into the network against extreme weather events. For example, investing in more resilient solutions e.g. develop sustained requirement for heating/ cooling technologies across the network, invest in sustainable products and proposition development and invest in technologies which reduce the number of physical network sites needed (e.g. full fibre).
