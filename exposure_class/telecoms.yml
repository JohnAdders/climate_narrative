            The telecommunication industry is not what one would think of when considering
            transition risk, but it will be impacted to some extent as well. 
            Telecommunication companies, just like any others, will be forced to decrease
            their carbon footpring. In this case the efforts will focus on

            + Energy efficiency of the technologies, including cooling

            + Transition the fleet of trucks to electric vehicles

            + Ensuring sufficient supply of renewable electric energy at acceptable cost
