description: "
    The *construction sector* includes establishments primarily responsible for the construction of buildings. The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. The onsite assembly of pre-cut, panelised, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary buildings are also included in this sector. Establishments in this sector are classified based on the types of buildings they construct. 
    
    
    The construction sector includes companies that are, for example, involved in the following:
    
    
    1.	The construction of residential and commercial buildings. This also includes remodelling or renovating work for the buildings.
    
    
    2.	The construction of distribution lines and related buildings and structures for utilities (i.e. water, sewer, petroleum, gas, power, and communication) or the structures that are integral parts of the utility systems (power plants, sewer lines, oil and gas pipelines, telecommunications transmitting/receiving towers, etc.)
    
    
    3.	The construction of highways (including elevated), streets, roads, airport runways, public sidewalks, bridges, and other heavy and civil engineering constructions. 
    
    
    4.	The installation or servicing of equipment that is part of building mechanical systems such as plumbing, heating, electrical wiring, etc.

            Aviation sector will continue to play a role in meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation in the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late policy action enabling a fossil fuelled recovery out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO2 emissions increasing until 2030 and a decrease in CO2 after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand, whereas the divergent scenario results in a gradual reduction in CO2 emissions. Policies and regulatory frameworks implemented at regional level rather than international level or evolving at a different speed depending on the region, could result in an un-level playing field for manufacturers and operators. Both these scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.
            
            
            The high transition risk scenario could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the aviation sector.

            The changes carbon emission pricing or taxes and consumer preferences could potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:
            
            
            * **Increased operating costs of the underlying companies to be insured could impact their demand for insurance.** The gradual but significant rise in carbon and energy prices could potentially result in financial impacts, as aviation firms carbon emissions face a rising price in the form a carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price, especially for airlines reliant on fossil-based aviation fuels. 
            
            
            * **Change in regulations covering energy efficiency standards would lead to increasing compliance requirements.** Governments may conclude it impossible to decarbonise flying in line with national targets and so limit demand by raising the cost of air travel and limiting airport capacity and could lead to changes in the level and type of insurance coverage required.
            
            
            * **Asset valuations of aviation companies could be re-priced** based on the re-adjusted expectations of the use of low-carbon products and energy efficient technologies in the future. Higher fuel costs impose a risk that older and less efficient aircraft will have to be retired earlier than originally planned, resulting in an impairment of their residual value. 
            
            
            * **Changing consumer preferences**, these could lead to changes in revenue due to lower customers numbers as a result of change in environmental expectations that could impact this underwriting class. Flight shame could also increase along with a modal shift to (high speed) rail, reducing demand for aviation. Slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals disposable income.
            
            
            The profitability of this sector will also depend on the relevant companies proactively investing in innovation and new technology. For example:
            
            
            * Alternative fuel sources (e.g. airlines could invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in the short term whilst more complex solutions such as hydrogen and electric aircraft are developed)
            
            
            * Energy efficient aircraft and infrastructure (e.g. more efficient lighting and heating in hangars and airports) 
            
            
            * Intelligent routing and smart technologies which support climate-optimized flying   
            
            
            These actions could also lead to positive gains in commercial reputation and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers will proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green strategy as well as potentially have knock-on impacts for insurance pricing, terms and conditions and coverage.

    low:
        always: "
            In low transition risk scenarios, the demand for construction is likely to increase. The construction sector was responsible for 13% of global GDP in 2020, and this share is expected to increase as the global population continues to rise. However, the low transition risk scenario could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could partially offset growth in demand for the construction sector.
            
            
            While the construction sector will continue to play a role in meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation in a low transition risk scenario, driven by immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, will lead to a gradual reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price. These are likely to have an impact on the profitability this sector; constructing assets such as buildings, roads, railways, tunnels and bridges involves emitting carbon, primarily through electricity use, fuel usage for vehicles and plants, and from the production of materials, such as steel and cement. As per Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (Global ABC) report, in 2020, the Buildings and Construction sector accounted for 36% of global energy consumption.

            The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and energy mix could potentially the construction sector as a result in one or more of the following impacts:
            
            
            * **Reduced Revenues**. Negative public sentiment around sustainability and climate change issues could affect all the value chain players leading to reduced demand for products and services. 
            
            
            * **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions directly or indirectly through expensive conventional building material or non-renewable energy for its operations. 
            
            
            * **Increased capital expenditures.** New investments will be required to improve the energy efficiency of the construction process including but not limited to using fewer or different materials, employing different production techniques, using lower emission transportation, optimizing transportation routes, planning fewer journeys, minimising the use of non-renewable grid energy and recycling. 
            
            
            * **Increased R&D investments** will be needed to explore alternative construction processes and materials to improve the emission intensity.
            
            
            * **Falling asset values** impairment of the economic value of company assets such as outdated machinery and material transportation vehicles with poor energy efficiency.
            
            
            The construction sector is likely to be impacted by steady decarbonization in building materials and its own operations. Among building materials, cement will incur the most impact due to its limited capacity to improve CO2 intensity and increasing carbon price. A sharper focus would be required for the cement industry to improve its clinker-to-cement ratio and deploy carbon storage technologies.

            The aviation sector and its associated underwriting class are also exposed to physical risk. Chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-level and mean temperatures) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding could severely affect aircraft performance, significantly disrupt operations through frequent re-routings and temporary closures of airspace and airports, as well as damage infrastructure and aircraft with detrimental effects on costs and earnings. Whilst the aviation sector is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the low physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming will increase weather variations. This will lead to increasing disruption to the aviation sector which could impact the profitability for these companies and therefore could impact the aviation underwriting class as the physical effects of climate change could result in increased claims and increased premiums potentially resulting in some of the aviation underwriting risks becoming either uninsurable or unaffordable.
            
            
            Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for aviation products and services with knock-on impacts for sectors insurance needs.

            The following examples illustrate how the aviation sector could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
            
            
            * **Higher average temperatures** can decrease regulated take-off weight leading to lower passenger and cargo loads. Increased fuel uplift to cope with weather related rerouting will further reduce a flights payload. 
            
            
            * **Increased frequency of atmospheric turbulences, storms and heatwaves** can increase flight times, affect passenger comfort and safety, damage aircraft, and induce large scale rerouting or flight cancellations.
            
            
            * **Flooding** can damage infrastructure and grounded aircraft.
            
            
            With a large rise in global temperatures the physical effects of climate change could materially alter the existence, attractiveness or viability of some destinations, decreasing demand for some aviation services. For example, demand could decrease for airline routes serving destinations relying on climate conditions for attracting visitors (e.g. snow cover for skiing resorts) or destinations impacted by sea level inundation. Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals disposable income.
            
            
            There are a number of mitigating actions these companies can take against the high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into their operations against extreme weather events. For example, investing in more resilient solutions e.g. continuously review flight plans to ensure optimal routings, standby engineers to reduce technical fault repair time, and increase flood-mitigating construction standards.
