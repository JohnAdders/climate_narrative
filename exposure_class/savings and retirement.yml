name: Savings and Retirement

description: "
    The Savings and Retirement underwriting class covers products such as pensions, investment bonds, with-profits, unit-linked investments and annuities, written on an individual or scheme basis.
    
    
    Customers may buy products that enable them to save for retirement by investing a certain amount of their income regularly, or by paying a lump sum. These monies are then invested by the provider to create the appropriate income streams as set out in the terms and conditions of the product, on an ongoing basis, in retirement, or both.Providers may wrap or structure products to reduce costs and / or improve customer outcomes, thus enabling different customer groups to be invested in the same investment strategies. 
    
    
    Providers that write Savings and Retirement business are exposed to various risks, including mortality, persistency, expenses, as well as market and credit risks.

            In the disorderly transition risk scenarios, late policy action, delayed transition driven by a late policy action enables a fossil fuelled recovery out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon prices are increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the Divergent Net Zero scenario CO<sub>2</sub> emissions start to be reduced earlier, and as a result, more gradually. This will lead to a significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, probably associated with a drive towards cleaner air (due to for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion engines). This could cause a reduction in pollution which could in turn result into a better health outcome and could result in annuities being paid out for longer durations, which would negatively impact the profit margins of annuity providers. At the same time, better health in policyholders of other savings and retirement products will improve mortality, leading to savings products becoming more profitable from longer durations in force, and improved morbidity, leading to higher rates of savings and fewer lapses.
            
            
            The disorderly/divergent transition risk scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could result in reduced real household incomes, leading to lower savings rates, or increased lapses, or both. These GDP impacts may be expected to last for the period of the transition, with GDP stabilising thereafter.

            **Pollution effect**
            
            
            It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing greenhouse gases will probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as CO2 and CH4) that lead to warming but do not directly impact health, and the production of pollutants (such as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful to health. 
            
            
            Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars are replaced with electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable sources), some climate outcomes may achieve one and not the other. For example:
            
            
            * If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this will address the particulates but not the greenhouse effect. 
            
            
            * If we increase biomass burning, this may reduce the greenhouse effect but actually contribute to local particulate pollution. 
            
            
            * If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK) but without global buy-in, then this will also reduce the correlation.
            
            
            In the disorderly/divergent transition risk scenarios, there is potential for fewer deaths and a positive outcome for health relating to air pollution, the reduction of pollution could result in a reduction of cancers (especially lung) and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections, but also cardiovascular disease ), although we note that this is very much dependent on the fuel mix generating electrical power for the grid. This is likely to have a material effect on annuity providers, as the incidence of cancers and other diseases increases with age. If annuity policyholders are living longer due to reduced incidences in such diseases, annuity providers are at risk of reduced profits or greater losses resulting from payments being made for longer durations than anticipated when the annuities were originally priced.
            
            
            **GDP growth effect**
            
            
            The disorderly/divergent transition risk scenarios could lead to a moderate to severe fall in GDP growth. A slower GDP growth would potentially constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, medical etc. Assuming that greater funding is correlated to some extent with mortality and morbidity outcomes, this means any climate scenario could have an impact on mortality and morbidity via its impact on GDP. The short-term nature of any GDP impact in a high transition risk scenario may be expected to have an equivalent short-term impact on mortality rates. New diseases may emerge, resulting in epidemics or pandemics, thereby increasing mortality and morbidity rates.
            
            
            **Impact on pricing or product design**
            
            
            To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, morbidity market and credit risks, the disorderly/divergent transition risk scenarios could have an impact on the pricing of saving and retirement products, although this is likely to be modest. Customers may also switch to sustainable investment products, increasing lapse rates for those organisations who do not have such products in their range, and increasing inflows for those organisations that do.  In a disorderly transition, transition costs are likely to be high and concentrated in a short time. This may be expected to increase expenses.

            Savings and Retirement exposures are impacted by household incomes, which affect savings rates, as well as health outcomes, which affect mortality. The early/orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, will lead to a gradual reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, and this could probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner air (due to for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion engines). This would cause a reduction in pollution which could in turn result into a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke. This could result in annuities being paid out for longer durations, which could negatively impact the profit margins of annuity providers. At the same time, better health could improve mortality, leading to savings and retirement products becoming more profitable from longer durations in force. Improved morbidity could lead to higher rates of savings and fewer lapses. 
            
            
            The early/orderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could result in reduced real household incomes, leading to lower savings rates, or increased lapses, or both. It may also be expected that governments are likely to be able to maintain or even increase current levels of health and social care spending, due to the expected mild impact on GDP.

physical:
    high:
        always: "
            In the high physical risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in an important disruption that could have significant impact on the saving and retirement underwriting class.  Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average temperatures and rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could promote the development of diseases and the worsening of illnesses, and impact population health and therefore mortality and morbidity risks, although this is dependent on location and may not be as material in the UK as other locations. Mortality risk is more relevant to annuity providers, while morbidity risk is more relevant to providers of other savings and retirement products.  
            
            
            Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact population health as well as savings rates. Household income may therefore fall, leading to increased lapses or lower amounts invested, thereby reducing profitability for savings and retirement providers.

            **GDP growth effect**
            
            
            GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nations health and thus indirectly levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate any GDP growth. However, higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater on average if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas. 
            
            
            Significant GDP growth reductions could lead to reductions in NHS funding which, assuming that funding is correlated to some extent with morbidity outcomes, would have negative impacts on household incomes and savings rates. Savings will therefore be expected to be accessed sooner, increasing lapse rates, as well as asset outflows. Inflows will also be correspondingly lower as savings rates reduce, due to higher morbidity affecting policyholders capacity to earn and save income. Any increase in lapse rates will drive up per policy expenses (as a fixed cost base is spread out over fewer policies). Severe physical risk impacts to company infrastructure (e.g. data centres and offices) will drive up unit costs. The cost of ensuring redundancy and resiliency will also increase.
            
            
            **Temperature and weather effect**
            
            
            In a high physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose significant challenges that in turn could impact the saving and retirement underwriting class. For example:
            
            
            * **Mortality**: A level increase in temperature in the UK will lead to a reduction in deaths since the reduction in excess deaths due to cold weather may outweigh any increase excess deaths due to warmer weather and the risk of prolonged heat waves. However, to the extent that any increase in temperatures comes with an increase in the variability of temperatures, we could see an increase in both Winter and Summer excess mortality. 
            
            
            * **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment periods for annuity providers. 
            
            
            **Impact on pricing or product design**
            
            
            To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, morbidity, market and credit risks, the high physical risk scenario could have an impact on the pricing of saving and retirement products.

Low physical risk impacts to companies infrastructure will not put upward pressure on expenses, unless the infrastructure is located in areas affected by severe weather events.
