name: Savings and Retirement

description: |
  The **Savings and Retirement** underwriting class covers products such as
  pensions, investment bonds, with-profits, unit-linked investments and
  annuities, written on an individual or scheme basis.

  Customers may buy products that enable them to save for retirement by
  investing a certain amount of their income regularly, or by paying a lump sum.
  These monies are then invested by the provider to create the appropriate
  income streams as set out in the terms and conditions of the product, on an
  ongoing basis, in retirement, or both. Providers may wrap or structure
  products to reduce costs and / or improve customer outcomes, thus enabling
  different customer groups to be invested in the same investment strategies.
  Providers that write Savings and Retirement business are exposed to various
  risks, including mortality, persistency, expenses, as well as market and
  credit risks.
transition:
  high:
    always: |
      In Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, driven by late policy
      action, enables a fossil fuelled recovery out of the economic crisis
      brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing
      until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon prices are
      increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the Divergent Net
      Zero scenario CO<sub>2</sub> emissions start to be reduced immediately but
      divergently. This will lead to a significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions by 2050, probably associated with a drive towards cleaner air
      (due to for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles
      with internal combustion engines). This could cause a reduction in
      pollution which could in turn result into a better health outcome and
      could result in annuities being paid out for longer durations, which would
      negatively impact the profit margins of annuity providers. At the same
      time, better health in policyholders of other savings and retirement
      products will improve mortality, leading to savings products becoming more
      profitable from longer durations in force, and improved morbidity, leading
      to higher rates of savings and fewer lapses.

      These scenarios could also result in moderate to severe reduction in GDP
      growth which in turn reduces household incomes and leads to lower savings
      rates, or increased lapses, or both. These GDP impacts may be expected to
      last for the period of the transition, with GDP stabilising thereafter.
    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      In the Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios moderate to severe
      reduction in GDP growth are likely, with equally severe repercussions on
      the levels of health and social care spending. A slower GDP growth would
      potentially constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social
      care, medical etc. This is correlated with poorer mortality and morbidity
      rates. The short-term nature of any GDP impact in these scenarios may be
      expected to have an equivalent short-term impact on mortality rates.

      The moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth are likely with equally
      severe repercussions on the levels of health and social care spending. A
      slower GDP growth would potentially constrain the growth in spending on
      NHS, public health, social care, medical etc. this could also result in
      lower household incomes for the duration of the transition, reducing
      savings rates and therefore asset inflows. Lapse rates may also be
      expected to increase as a result.

      In a disorderly transition, transition costs are likely to be high and
      concentrated in a short time. This may be expected to increase expenses.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing
      greenhouse gases will probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner
      air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important
      to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as
      CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>4</sub>) that lead to warming but do not
      directly impact health, and the production of pollutants (such as
      particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful
      to health.

      Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with
      advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars are replaced with
      electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable
      sources), some climate outcomes may achieve one and not the other. For
      example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this will address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning, this may reduce the greenhouse effect
        but actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      - If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK)
        but without global buy-in, then this will also reduce the correlation.

      In the disorderly transition risk scenario, there is potential for fewer
      deaths and a positive outcome for health relating to air pollution, the
      reduction of pollution could result in a reduction of cancers (especially
      lung) and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections,
      but also cardiovascular disease ), although we note that this is very much
      dependent on the fuel mix generating electrical power for the grid. This
      is likely to have a material effect on annuity providers, as the incidence
      of cancers and other diseases increases with age. If annuity policyholders
      are living longer due to reduced incidences in such diseases, annuity
      providers are at risk of reduced profits or greater losses resulting from
      payments being made for longer durations than anticipated when the
      annuities were originally priced.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, morbidity market and
      credit risks, the disorderly/divergent transition risk scenarios could
      have an impact on the pricing of saving and retirement products, although
      this is likely to be modest. Customers may also switch to sustainable
      investment products, increasing lapse rates for those organisations who do
      not have such products in their range, and increasing inflows for those
      organisations that do but any inflows from such switches may be expected
      to be lower than what might be.
  low:
    always: |
      Savings and Retirement exposures are impacted by household incomes, which
      affect savings rates, as well as health outcomes, which affect mortality.
      Early/orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate policy
      reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon
      legislation, will lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 (due to for example, an increase in
      electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion engines)
      which will lead to emissions reductions and cleaner air. This could result
      in annuities being paid out for longer durations, which could negatively
      impact the profit margins of annuity providers. At the same time, better
      health could improve mortality, leading to savings and retirement products
      becoming more profitable from longer durations in force, and improved
      morbidity could lead to higher rates of savings and fewer lapses.

      The early/orderly transition risk scenarios could lead to a limited
      relative reduction in GDP growth. However, any negative impacts on GDP as
      a result of transition risk are likely to be smaller than in other
      scenarios. This could also result in reduced real household income,
      leading to lower savings rates, or increased lapses, or both.
    high_materiality: |
      In early/orderly transition risk scenarios changes in diet (e.g. reduction
      in calorie intake or shift to plant-based diets) may result in lower
      levels of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and may also
      improve mortality rates.

      **GDP growth effect**

      Also as a result of the expected mild impact on GDP, customers are likely
      to experience correspondingly low impacts to incomes. They may therefore
      be able to maintain their savings rates. Lapses, and related impacts on
      asset flows may be expected to be correspondingly low.

      Transition costs are likely to be low and spread out over a moderate time
      period. This may be expected to increase expenses, but only modestly.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing
      greenhouse gases will probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner
      air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important
      to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as
      CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>4</sub>) that lead to warming but do not
      directly impact health, and the production of pollutants (such as
      particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful
      to health.

      Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with
      advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars are replaced with
      electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable
      sources), some climate outcomes may achieve one and not the other. For
      example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this will address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning this may reduce the greenhouse effect but
        actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      - If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK)
        but without global buy-in, then this will also reduce the correlation.

      In orderly transition risk scenarios, there is potential for fewer deaths
      and a positive outcome for health relating to air pollution. The reduction
      in pollution could result in a reduction of cancers (especially lung) and
      respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections), but also
      cardiovascular disease, although we note that this is very much dependent
      on the fuel mix generating electrical power for the grid. This is likely
      to have a material effect on annuity providers, as the incidence of
      cancers and other diseases increase with age. If annuity policyholders are
      living longer, annuity providers are at risk of reduced profits or greater
      losses resulting from payments being made for longer durations than
      anticipated when the annuities were originally priced.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, market and credit
      risks, the orderly transition risk scenarios could have an impact on the
      pricing of saving and retirement products, although this is likely to be
      modest. Customers may also switch to sustainable investment products,
      increasing lapse rates for those organisations who do not have such
      products in their range, and increasing inflows for those organisations
      that do.
physical:
  high:
    always: |
      In the high physical risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in
      severe temperature increases and large increases in both the frequency and
      severity if weather events that could have significant impact on the
      saving and retirement underwriting class. Chronic gradual impacts (such as
      higher average temperatures and rises in the spread of vector-borne
      diseases) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity
      of weather events (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat
      and cold) could promote the development of diseases and the worsening of
      illnesses, and impact population health and therefore mortality and
      morbidity risks, although this is dependent on location and may not be as
      material in the UK as other locations. Mortality risk is more relevant to
      annuity providers, while morbidity risk is more relevant to providers of
      other savings and retirement products.

      Vector-borne diseases may also be expected to be more common and spread
      more quickly. All these factors may be expected to have severe negative
      impacts on GDP which could negatively impact population health as well as
      savings rates. Household income and savings rates may therefore fall,
      leading to increased lapses or lower amounts invested, thereby reducing
      profitability for savings and retirement providers.
    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      Higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending
      on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is
      reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater on
      average if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how
      spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP
      would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas.

      In a high physical risk scenario, the significant reductions in GDP growth
      will reduce health and social care spending, causing mortality rates to
      rise.

      Significant GDP growth reductions could lead to reductions in NHS funding
      which, assuming that funding is correlated to some extent with morbidity
      outcomes, would have negative impacts on household incomes and savings
      rates. Savings will therefore be expected to be accessed sooner,
      increasing lapse rates, as well as asset outflows. Inflows will also be
      correspondingly lower as savings rates reduce, due to higher morbidity
      affecting policyholders capacity to earn and save income. Any increase in
      lapse rates will drive up per policy expenses (as a fixed cost base is
      spread out over fewer policies). Severe physical risk impacts to company
      infrastructure (e.g. data centres and offices) will drive up unit costs.
      The cost of ensuring redundancy and resiliency will also increase.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      In a high physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate effects
      such as temperature variation and weather events could pose significant
      challenges that in turn could impact the saving and retirement
      underwriting class. For example:

      - **Mortality**: Due to the increased incidence in catastrophes, mortality
        rates for certain customer segments (depending on location) may also be
        expected to rise. A level increase in temperature in the UK will lead to
        a reduction in deaths since the reduction in excess deaths due to cold
        weather may outweigh any increase excess deaths due to warmer weather
        and the risk of prolonged heat waves. However, to the extent that any
        increase in temperatures comes with an increase in the variability of
        temperatures, we could see an increase in both Winter and Summer excess
        mortality.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is
        dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also
        differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings
        rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment
        periods for annuity providers.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, morbidity, market and
      credit risks, the high physical risk scenario could have an impact on the
      pricing of saving and retirement products.

      Greater prevalence and severity of physical risk events may be expected to
      negatively impact customer standards of living. Savings will therefore be
      expected to be accessed sooner, increasing lapse rates, as well as asset
      outflows. Inflows will also be correspondingly lower as savings rates
      reduce, due to higher morbidity affecting policyholders capacity to earn
      and save income. Any increase in lapse rates will drive up per policy
      expenses (as a fixed cost base is spread out over fewer policies). Severe
      physical risk impacts to company infrastructure (e.g. data centres and
      offices) will drive up unit costs. The cost of ensuring redundancy and
      resiliency will also increase.
  low:
    always: |
      In the low physical risk scenario, it may be expected that climate change
      is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on
      the savings and retirement underwriting class. Chronic effects (such as
      higher average global temperatures and potential rises in the spread of
      vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency
      and severity of weather events (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and
      extreme heat and cold) could promote the development of diseases and the
      worsening of illnesses, and impact population health. Mortality and
      morbidity may be expected to increase as a result, although this is
      dependent on location and may not be as material in the UK as other
      locations. Mortality risk is more relevant to annuity providers, while
      morbidity risk is more relevant to providers of other savings and
      retirement products.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
      over time. The low physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      GDP impact which could negatively impact population health as well as
      savings rates. Household income may therefore fall slightly, leading to
      increased lapses or lower amounts invested, thereby reducing profitability
      for savings and retirement providers. Asset flows may also reduce.
    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      Higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending
      on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is
      reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater on
      average if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how
      spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP
      would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas.

      Significant GDP growth reductions could lead to reductions in NHS funding
      which, assuming that funding is correlated to some extent with morbidity
      outcomes, would have negative impacts on household incomes and savings
      rates. Lapses are therefore expected to increase slightly or even remain
      the same. If lapse rates remain at current levels, no upward pressure on
      expenses might be expected.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      Even in a low physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate
      effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose
      significant challenges that in turn could impact the saving and retirement
      underwriting class. For example:

      - **Mortality**: Mortality rates may be expected to remain the same, or
        even improve as a result of this factor, but depending on where the
        customers are located, this could be offset by an increase in mortality
        rates as a result of severe weather events. A level increase in
        temperature in the UK will lead to a reduction in deaths since the
        reduction in excess deaths due to cold weather may outweigh any increase
        excess deaths due to warmer weather and the risk of prolonged heat
        waves. However, to the extent that any increase in temperatures comes
        with an increase in the variability of temperatures, we could see an
        increase in both Winter and Summer excess mortality.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is
        dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also
        differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings
        rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment
        periods for annuity providers.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, morbidity market and
      credit risks, the low physical risk scenario could have an impact on the
      pricing of saving and retirement products. Low physical risk also impacts
      to company infrastructure will not put upward pressure on expenses, unless
      the infrastructure is located in areas affected by severe weather events.
      Asset flows may also be little affected, as household income and savings
      rates are expected to remain largely unchanged.
