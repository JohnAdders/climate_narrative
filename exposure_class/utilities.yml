name: Utilities

description: |
  The **Utilities** sector comprises of companies which provide basic amenities such
  as water, sewage services, electricity, and gas. The sector includes companies
  that:

  - Produce or distribute electricity (Electric Utilities)

  - Distribute and transmit natural and manufactured gas (Gas Utilities)

  - Purchase and redistribute water to the end consumer (Water Utilities)

  - Have diversified activities in addition to core electric utility, gas
    utility or water utility operations (Multi-Utilities)

  - Operate as Independent Power Producers (IPPs), Gas and Power Marketing and
    Trading Specialists and Integrated Energy Merchants

  - Generate and distribute electricity using renewable sources (Renewable
    Electricity Companies)

  Note that this sector excludes companies that are primarily involved in gas
  exploration or production; storage and/or transportation of oil, gas and
  refined products; and manufacture of capital equipment used to generate
  electricity from renewable and non-renewable sources.

      Whilst the utilities sector could continue to play a critical role in
      meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in
      energy generation in the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late
      policy action enabling a "fossil fuelled recovery" out of the economic
      crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 to compensate
      for the inaction beforehand. The Divergent Net Zero scenario results in
      immediate but divergent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions. Both these
      scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability of individual
      companies and the sector overall.

      In a disorderly transition scenario, the utilities sector is likely to be
      impacted. The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy
      prices could potentially result in financial impacts; the extent could
      depend on how reliant the company's production /revenue mix is on
      low-carbon electricity and gas, the client's transition plans and how this
      compares to the sector average. For example:

      - **Reduced revenue** for carbon intensive utilities as consumers switch
        to low carbon/electrified alternatives for heating and become more
        energy autonomous.

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions via tax or
        cap & trade clearing price.

      - **Readjusted capital expenditures** including new investments required
        to pivot business model towards renewable electricity generation.

      In a disorderly transition risk scenario, the utilities sector is likely
      to be significantly impacted. Risks are heavily concentrated in carbon
      intensive utilities that do not have adequate transition plans, whilst
      opportunities exist for utilities drawing most heavily on zero and low
      carbon activities. Driven by increased electrification, total electricity
      capacity and generation jumps markedly, and the underlying sources change
      dramatically. Solar is the dominant technology representing around half of
      electricity generation capacity by 2050, completely displacing coal
      (before 2030) and gas (between 2030 and 2035).

      Nevertheless, in a disorderly transition scenario one has to be careful
      about also expecting valuation uplifts in firms that act as 'pure plays' on
      an accelerated energy transition, like Renewable Electricity Companies.
      That is because valuations for that subset of firms are already high and
      arguably pricing in more aggressive transition and decarbonisation
      scenarios. However, this is less of a constraint in the Divergent Net Zero
      scenario because a transition of that significance and rapidity is not in
      the price, in our judgement.

      Overall, electricity generation through carbon intensive primary energy
      sources (i.e. those that can be used directly as they appear in the
      natural environment) decreases as the share of low carbon primary energy
      sources in the generation mix increases.

      The important role of technology should also be noted. Forecasting
      technology pathways is just as difficult as forecasting policy pathways.
      Even in disorderly transition scenarios, the zero and low carbon 'winners'
      cannot be predicted with uncertainty. The relative cost reductions and
      growth rates of solar and wind technologies, government nuclear investment
      plans, and the viability of biomass, hydrogen and carbon capture and
      storage technologies at greater scale are all uncertain.

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) for gas
      rises, for biomass rises significantly, whilst primary energy prices for
      coal fall before returning to 2020 levels. Secondary energy price (i.e.
      paid by large scale consumers) for electricity rises initially before
      returning to 2020 levels.

      Because the utilities sector is so diverse, there is no single solution,
      but rather a range of strategies based on the circumstances of each
      company could need to be deployed in a disorderly transition risk scenario
      to maintain revenues and minimise the long-term financial impact. Examples
      include expanding renewable energy development, investing in more
      efficient thermal power generation and retiring low-efficient coal thermal
      power generation, supporting the development of low carbon alternates to
      natural gas, and increasing the weight of electricity in their portfolio.

      Whilst the utilities sector could continue to play a critical role in
      meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in
      energy generation in early/orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by
      immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies,
      and carbon legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price. These
      are likely to have an impact on the sector, affecting profitability of
      individual companies and the sector overall.

physical:

    always: |
      The utilities sector is exposed to the physical impacts of climate change
      including both the chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and acute
      effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events
      such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones and flooding.
      Whilst the utilities sector is used to responding to and managing changing
      weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and
      global warming could increase weather variations. This could lead to
      increasing disruption to the utilities sector and impact the profitability
      of these companies.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the utilities sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**:

      - **Higher average temperatures** could reduce demand for energy used for
        heating, particularly natural gas. Performance of combined-cycle power
        stations could decrease with an increase in temperature.

      **Acute Impacts**:

      - **Flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather events** can cause
        water contamination, damage overhead powerlines and other
        infrastructure, and disrupt operations. The utilities sector in
        particular is especially susceptible to these events; a lot of
        generating infrastructure is located in areas exposed to increased
        flooding risk as well as tropical cyclone effects, and a large
        proportion of the value of most utilities is comprised of tangible
        (physical) capital.

      There are many mitigating actions that companies can take against the low
      physical risks mentioned above. For example, investing in resilient
      solutions e.g. underground power line networks, disaster prevention
      systems (e.g. vegetation management to keep tree limbs a safe distance
      from power lines), and increase contribution of electricity businesses vs
      gas businesses.
