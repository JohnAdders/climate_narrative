name: Utilities

description: 
    The utility sector is relatively major source of emissions. 
    It may overlap with 'coal' category, so for now consider the coal-based electricity generation
    to be excluded from the category.


    It has to be noted that this sector is usually strictly regulated, making it dependant on
    the regulatory/government decisions if the existing business models needs changes.

            The utility sector comprises several subsectors, all of which will be affected
            by the transition.


            + Electricity. For sure the production from renewable sources will increase,
            which may be challenging to the network due to instable (weather-dependent)
            nature of the production.
            Coal is only the first fuel to eliminate, subsequently also other fossil fuels
            in particular gas may prove risky, although it is ambiguous.
            On one hand it provides a practical way to balance the instability of the 
            renewables, on the other hand it still contributes to CO<sub>2</sub> emission.
            Nuclear energy constitutes a very low-carbon alternative, but it seems not
            widely acceptable, especially after Fukushima incident the world tends to switch
            off the nuclear plants rather than build new ones.


            + Gas supply. The use of gas is common both in industry and households (heating).
            Usage of natural gas will likely be limited. A potential opportunity, but still
            technologically immature, is to mix natural gas with hydrogen or even totally 
            switch the existing gas infrastructure to hydrogen use.


            + Garbage. Storing waste is a source of greenhouse gases (methane), which can be used
            as a biofuel
            

            + Water and sewage. Energy efficiency and electrification of technology processes
            will be required.

            For the energy and electricity industry, the direct consequence of chronic
            changes will be gradual switch in the demand profile. Generally, as temperature
            increases, more energy will be required for cooling and less for heating.
            The particular impacts are location-dependent, 


            Also the water industry is very likely to be affected and may require
            material capital investment to continue providing water.
            In some areas the water deficit may even require imposing use restrictions.


            Also the acute physial risks will result in more strain to many type of utilities.
            For example, heatwaves may be challenging for electricity grid and water supply.
            Flooding may in principle affect any large physical facilities but the impact
            will be severe if essential public servicies are interrupted.
