    Metals and mining
    I am not sure if this sector should cover coal mining or is it more appropriate
    to separate it. For a moment consider this as 'mining ex coal' sector.
transition:
    high:
        always: &transition
            Transition risk affects this sector to a large extent, even if coal mining
            (which will need to be phased out) is excluded from the scope of the sector.
            Fossil fuels are used in variety of activities including smelting and refining.
            Their contribution to the global warming needs to decrease by switching fuel 
            (e.g. to hydrogen).


            It may also be necessary to consider arbon capture, not only in combustion
            processes but in fugitive emissions as well.


            The transition may turn out to give opportunities to some companies in the sector as well.
            As demand for batteries will grow so will demand for required raw materials
            (cobalt, lithium, nickel), which may prove beneficial to companies mining these.

            The physical risk is not expected to affect the sector in a particular way.
