name: Metals and Mining

description: |
  Companies in the **Mining** sector (except Oil and Gas) primarily
  engage in mining, mine site development, and beneficiating (i.e. preparing -
  crushing, screening, washing, sizing, concentrating, and flotation) metallic
  minerals and non-metallic minerals, including coal. The term "mining" is used in
  the broad sense to include ore extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating,
  customarily done at the mine site. The Mining sector includes companies that
  have complete responsibility for operating mines and quarries (except oil and
  gas wells) and those that operate mines and quarries (except oil and gas
  wells) for others on a contract or fee basis. Also included are companies
  engaged in providing support activities (except site preparation and related
  construction activities) on a contract or fee basis for the mining and
  quarrying of metallic minerals and for the extraction of metal ores.
  Exploration for these minerals is also included in this industry. Exploration
  (except geophysical surveying and mapping services) includes traditional
  prospecting methods, such as taking core samples and making geological
  observations at prospective sites.
transition:
  high:
    always: |
      By 2050, in a disorderly transition risk scenario, coal represents 0.47%
      (in the Delayed Transition scenario) or 0.63% (in the Divergent Net Zero
      scenario) of global energy demand, compared to 29% in 2020.
      Carbon-intensive sectors such as coal mining are consequently some of the
      most vulnerable to transition.

      Coal Mining is a special case among its sectoral peers, the changing
      patterns in energy consumption, driven by societal change, national energy
      strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and
      long-term impact on demand for coal, or even lead to its total abandon,
      with no need for new coal mines or extensions of existing ones. The mining
      of minerals needed for clean energy transitions (e.g. copper, lithium and
      nickel) could increases very rapidly, and mining expertise is likely to be
      highly valued in this context.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy prices could
      potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Reduced revenue for coal mining companies** due to decline in coal
        demand as consumers switch to low-carbon/electrified alternatives.

      - **Increased revenue for mining companies investing in other metals**
        widely used in the renewable energy and electric vehicles segments.

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions via tax or
        cap & trade clearing price as well as increase in mine site costs
        (labour, fuel, electricity cost at mine and mill). The increase in
        carbon price could lead to increases in operational costs. For example,
        gold mines in South Africa have the highest GHG intensity per unit of
        ore treated, and this intensity is 23 times higher than gold mines
        located in the US. According to S&P Global, US gold mines could face a
        5% increase in operating costs, whilst South Africa could face a near
        25% increase.

      In a disorderly transition risk scenario, the mining sector is likely to
      be impacted. Demand for coal decreases rapidly as the share of renewables
      in the electricity generation mix increases. This is driven by the
      increasing share of electric vehicles on the roads.

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) could also
      decrease compared to 2020 levels (more significantly in the divergent
      scenario compared to the delayed scenario).

      By 2050, the contraction in coal demand, in a disorderly transition risk
      scenario, could be offset by the need to increase mining of other raw
      minerals, including those vital to many clean energy technologies. Global
      demand for these critical minerals could rise rapidly. For example,
      lithium (used for batteries), platinum, palladium and other catalyst
      materials (used for hydrogen fuel cells and carbon capture), and rare
      earths (used for wind-turbine magnets), could all see a large increase in
      demand. More energy-efficient processing and widespread recycling, which
      are likely to put pressure on virgin-ore markets. Bauxite, copper, and
      iron ore could see growth from new decarbonization technologies at least
      partly offset by increased recycling rates. Although these critical
      mineral resources are not always located in the same locations or
      countries as existing coal mines, the skills and experience of mining
      companies could be essential to ensure that the supply of these minerals is
      able to match demand at reasonable prices. Many new mining projects could
      have to be developed rapidly and sustainably to fuel the transition, which
      could be challenging from an operating perspective.

physical:
  high:
    always: |
      The mining sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of climate
      change including both the chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and
      acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather
      events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones and
      flooding. Extreme weather events could also impact the national and global
      supply of chemicals and other materials needed for a mining site's process,
      plants, and mine equipment and impact the ability to ship concentrate to
      international markets. Whilst the mining sector is used to responding to
      and managing changing weather conditions, in the low physical risk
      scenario, climate change and global warming could increase weather
      variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to mining production
      which could significantly impact the profitability for these companies.
      Note there is a variation in exposure, depending on the mine's geographical
      location.

      The following examples illustrate how the mining sector could be impacted
      in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Water Stress** could lead to greater competition between mining
        companies as they fight for scarce water resources. It could also likely
        lead to an expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on
        protecting water supply and quality. This would incur hefty additional
        costs for water intensive industries such as mining. Around 30% to 50%
        of copper, gold, iron ore, and zinc productions are already concentrated
        in 'water stress hot-spots' (central Asia, Chilean coast, eastern
        Australia, the Middle East, southern Africa, western Australia, and a
        large zone in western North America). Changes to precipitation patterns
        could place increasing stress on the availability of water at these
        sites, as well as at sites not currently under water stress. Depending
        on the water intensiveness of the industrial process, such changes,
        while seemingly minor in percentage terms, could be critical to a mine's
        operations or license to operate.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Flooding** from extreme rains can also cause operational disruptions,
        including mine closure, washed-out roads, and unsafe water levels in
        tailing dams. At one open-pit coal mine, McKinsey observed 10% annual
        production losses from wet weather. Flooding affects iron ore and zinc
        more than others, based on their location, at 50% and 40% of global
        volume, respectively. McKinsey warns that the problem is expected to get
        worse, particularly in six "wet spots" likely to experience a 50 to 60%
        increase in extreme precipitation this century: northern Australia,
        South America, and southern Africa during Southern Hemisphere summer,
        and central and western Africa, India and Southeast Asia, and Indonesia
        during Southern Hemisphere winter.

      There are many mitigating actions that companies can take against the high
      physical risks mentioned above. For example, investing in resilient
      solutions e.g. technological solutions and internal performance standards
      to reduce water usage, infrastructure that meets high specifications,
      wildfire risk management programs including prescribed burning operations,
      and working with key suppliers and distributors to determine their
      resilience to extreme weather events and define alternative routes.
