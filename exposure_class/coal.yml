name: Coal mining and coal electricity
description: 
    Coal burning is currently the primary source of energy in many countries.
    At the same time it is a major source of CO<sub>2</sub> emission to the atmosphere.
transition:
    high:
        always:
            The coal mines and energy plants must be shut down
            in a relatively short period of time. This has direct adverse
            consequences for companies operating in this sector. 
        high_materiality:
            The coal sector has been indicated as high materiality, therefore this scenario
            is likely to put your company in danger.
        equity_like:
            Valuation of the companies operating in the coal sector will fall drastically,
            reflecting loss of prospect for future economic activity.
            The companies are likely to write off significant amounts of no longer usable PPE
            Time for any management reaction is very limited.
        bond_like:
            The shutdown of coal operations may even threaten the solvency of the companies
            operating in the sector.
    low:
        always:
            Unless efficient carbon capture technology is available,
            the coal mines and energy plants must be shut down. The impact
            of the companies in the sector is clearly adverse, but due to 
            reasonable transition measures and transition period there is
            some room for management reaction (e.g.
            switch in company profile towards renewable energy, 
            implementation of carbon capture technology,
            orderly and gradual shut down where necessary).
        high_materiality:
            The coal sector has been indicated as high materiality, therefore this scenario
            may significantly affect your company. 
        equity_like:
            The valuation of coal companies is likely to fall. The extent
            will depend on the detailed policy measures
            taken (in particular the activity of government to support the sector in transition).
physical:
    high:
        always:
            The physical risk is not expected to affect the sector in a particular way.
        high_materiality:
            In case of high materiality exposure to the sector
            it is recommended to review the underlying
            exposures in detail to find whether any of them is specifically prone to some
            aspect of transition risk (e.g. sea level rise, flooding, heatwaves).
    low:
        always:
            The physical risk is not expected to affect the sector in a particular way.
        high_materiality:
            Note that this is a high materiality sector for your company.
