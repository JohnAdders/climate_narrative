  The climate changes may have profound impact on insurance activity in various
  lines of business, The immediate direct impact for non-life insurers is change
  in level of weather losses. Also life insurers may be affected as some level
  of changes in mortality/morbidity rates may appear. The climate transition
  trend will likely manifest in underwriting activity. Some underwriting classes
  may disappear (e.g. commercial property for thermal coal plants) while other
  will rapidly develop (e.g. renewable energy generation), many others will
  change their nature (e.g. motor insurance due to electric cars superseding ICE
  engines). All insurers can also expect to be affected indirectly by assets
  held as value of investments will react in response to climate risk borne by
  issuers.
