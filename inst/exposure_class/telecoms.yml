  The **telecommunication** (telecom) sector is comprised of companies that
  provide telecommunications and services related to that activity (e.g.
  telephony, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP); cable and satellite
  television distribution services; Internet access; telecommunications
  reselling services). This sector is also engaged in operating, and/or
  providing access to facilities for the transmission of voice, data, text,
  sound, and video. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology
  or a combination of technologies. This sector also includes firms that are 
  primarily engaged in:

  - purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of
    telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless
    telecommunications services (except satellite) to businesses and households

  - providing specialised telecommunications services, such as satellite
    tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation

  - providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected
    with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting
    telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite
    systems; or

  - providing Internet access services or Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)
    services via client-supplied telecommunications connections.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the telecoms sector 
      could face rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase 
      energy prices, as well as falling asset values as current infrastructure 
      becomes increasingly obsolete.
    always: |
      While telecoms could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand
      for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation, driven
      by divergent or late policy reaction, societal change, national energy
      strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and
      long term impact on this sector, affecting profitability and consumer
      preferences.
    high_materiality: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the impacts could
      depend on how reliant the company's production/revenue mix is on low
      carbon electricity, the client's 'temperature alignment' score and how
      this compares to the sector average. For example:

      - **Increased operating costs**, the increases in carbon and energy prices
        could potentially result in financial impacts, as firms' carbon
        emissions face a rising price in the form of a carbon tax or cap and
        trade clearing price, particularly for copper and other lightweight
        materials commonly found in phones/ cables and network sites.

      - **Asset valuation of company reserves could be re-priced** based on the
        re-adjusted expectations of the use of low-carbon products and energy
        efficient technologies in the future. Failure to provide low carbon
        emissions in telecom material could affect the commercial reputation of
        the company and could lead to loss of customers and a decrease in
        revenue.

      - **Changing consumer preferences**, these could lead to changes in sales
        due to new/lost customers as a result of change in environmental
        performance.

      Increased carbon tax cost and new investment for renewables could increase 
      the electricity cost for the telecoms sector in the short-to-medium term, 
      peaking at around 2030 in the Divergent Net Zero scenario at ~26 USD (inflation 
      adjusted to 2010 baseline) per gigajoule. In the Delayed transition scenario 
      prices peak around 2035 at ~27 USD per gigajoule.

      The profitability of the telecom sector, in Disorderly 
      transition risk scenarios, could also depend on the relevant companies
      proactively investing in innovation and new technology and their ability
      to mitigate transition risks. For example:

      - invest in and roll out energy efficient technologies e.g. 5G & Fibre
        (balanced with expanding use cases driving energy consumption up),

      - use electric vehicles for engineering truck fleets;

      - switch to 100% renewables and green power purchase agreements (PPAs) for
        fixed and mobile networks;

      - develop on site energy generation and sustainable energy sourcing
        (offsite PPAs);

      - use natural resources more efficiently

      - use Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)
        technologies to better forecast network energy demands and measure
        consumption. The uses and new capabilities are adding to these
        technologies and are growing in year-on-year basis;

      - improve device battery technologies and packaging reduction;

      - embed sustainable supply chain & partnership strategy;

      - use 'Smart' network components which shutdown/start up in line with
        demand and usage;

      - integrate E-Waste circular economy and smart recycling into consumer
        propositions (e.g. O2 Recycle);

      - use 'Green Steel' in construction of telecoms infrastructure;

      - develop technology to foster, or directly work on, solutions that
        minimise need for travel (e.g. BT's Remote Diagnostic Station).

      These actions could also lead to gain positive commercial reputation and
      therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could
      proactively shop at businesses with an incorporated green strategy.

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, the telecoms sector could 
      face rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase energy 
      prices, as well as falling asset values as current infrastructure becomes 
      increasingly obsolete.

      While the telecom sector could continue to play a role in meeting customer
      demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation,
      in Orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate policy
      reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon

      In high physical risk scenarios, extreme weather events could increase 
      disruption and cause damage to infrastructure, resulting in severe impacts 
      for the telecoms sector.
    always: |
      The telecom sector is also exposed to physical risk. Chronic effects (e.g.
      raised sea-levels) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and
      severity of weather events such as flooding, high winds, fire and extreme
      temperatures could cause significant network damage or service impacts.
      Whilst the telecom industry is used to responding to and managing changing
      weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and
      global warming could increase weather variations. This could lead to
      increasing disruption to productivity in this sector which could
      significantly impact the profitability and the infrastructure for these
      companies and could therefore result in an increase in the operational
      costs (as operations become largely reactive to remediate issues), impact
      employment and potentially lead to a significant decline in revenue due to
      an inability to operate and meet customer demands. These are likely to have an 
      impact on this sector, affecting profitability and consumer preferences.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the telecom sector could be impacted
      in a high physical risk scenario:

      - **Flooding events** could pose risks to the telecom sector such as
        damage to infrastructure e.g. damage to facilities, water ingress and
        flooding of exchange buildings, base stations, cable ducts and chambers
        due to high rainfall and flooding. Marvell Technology Group Ltd., a
        company which makes network components for smartphones, has had their
        assets damaged by flooding.

      - Overhead access network, backhaul, and core network via poles and pylons
        at risk of damage by **severe winds**.

      - The increase in **wildfires** frequency and severity could also increase
        damage to infrastructure.

      - **Increase in precipitation** leading to interruption to or reduction in
        quality of wireless service, and an increase in frequency or severity of
        damage to low-lying infrastructure, access holes, transport structures &
        underground facilities. For example, Vodafone had disruptions to their
        services after one of their data centres flooded.

      - Loss of power to the network if the national grid is impacted by weather
        causes operational disruption.

      - **Extreme temperatures** causing overheating of equipment in base
        stations or street cabinets.

      There are several mitigating actions these companies can take against the
      high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into the network
      against extreme weather events. For example, investing in more resilient
      solutions e.g. develop sustained requirement for heating/ cooling
      technologies across the network, invest in sustainable products and
      proposition development and invest in technologies which reduce the number
      of physical network sites needed (e.g. full fibre).
