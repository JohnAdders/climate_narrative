  The **Utilities** sector comprises companies that provide basic amenities
  such as water, sewage services, electricity, and gas. The sector includes
  companies that:

  - Produce or distribute electricity (Electric Utilities)

  - Distribute and transmit natural and manufactured gas (Gas Utilities)

  - Purchase and redistribute water to the end consumer (Water Utilities)

  - Have diversified activities in addition to core electric utility, gas
    utility or water utility operations (Multi-Utilities)

  - Operate as Independent Power Producers (IPPs), Gas and Power Marketing and
    Trading Specialists and Integrated Energy Merchants

  - Generate and distribute electricity using renewable sources (Renewable
    Electricity Companies)

  Note that this sector excludes companies that are primarily involved in gas
  exploration or production; storage and/or transportation of oil, gas and
  refined products; and manufacture of capital equipment used to generate
  electricity from renewable and non-renewable sources.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the utility sector may 
      benefit from increased revenue as the global energy system becomes more 
      electrified, but face a rising carbon price which could increase production 
      costs for carbon intensive utilities without adequate transition plans.
    always: |
      The Disorderly transition scenarios are primarily characterised by their 
      more disruptive effects on the utility sector. This can be seen most 
      clearly when comparing the Below 2&deg;C scenario and the Delayed Transition 
      scenario. The two scenarios converge on similar long-term climate cumulative 
      emissions and temperature objectives. But while policy action consistent 
      with those objectives begins almost immediately in the Orderly Below 2&deg;C 
      scenario, it does not begin in earnest until 2030 in the Delayed Transition 
      scenario.
      
      This ultimately means that switching towards renewables and away from fossil 
      fuels is first slow and then more rapid, and that the negative effects of 
      carbon pricing on fossil fuel intensive utilities' revenues and margins take 
      a lot longer to emerge. The Divergent Net Zero scenario, on the other hand, 
      results in immediate but more divergent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions 
      across emitting sectors.  There would be considerable dispersion of impacts 
      across firms in the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, depending on the 
      carbon intensity of their production processes.

    high_materiality: |
      Changes in carbon pricing, electricity demand, the energy mix, and energy 
      prices are likely to dominate financial impacts, through the same revenue 
      and cost channels. However, in Disorderly transition risk scenarios, for a 
      given long-term emissions and temperature objective, effects will likely 
      be amplified, either because of policy divergences across sectors, or because 
      delayed decarbonisation requires greater decarbonisation later on.
      
      Comparing energy usage and mix patterns between the Net Zero 2050 and Divergent 
      Net Zero, and then the Below 2&deg;C and Delayed Transition scenarios, we 
      generally see similarly large shifts towards solar and wind generation, 
      and away from fossil fuel generation over the longer-term. A key difference, 
      however, is that under Delayed Transition, carbon prices must rise more quickly 
      and to a higher level, in order to force through the required rate of 
      decarbonisation. This has the potential to generate larger reductions in 
      total energy usage because rationing has to do more of the work than more 
      gradual technological change. And it also has the potential to be much more 
      damaging for the margins of more fossil fuel intensive utilities.
      
      As with the Orderly scenarios, the Disorderly transition risk scenarios are all 
      derived from an energy systems model that makes relatively favourable assumptions 
      about how the relative price of solar PV and, to a lesser extent, wind technologies 
      evolve relative to fossil fuels and nuclear energy. As a result, solar and wind become 
      the dominant technologies, with solar representing around half of electricity 
      generation capacity by 2050, completely displacing coal (before 2030) and gas 
      (between 2025 and 2030). These models also envision only a modest role for carbon, 
      capture and storage technologies to keep fossil fuel usage viable over the longer 
      term.

      Testing these assumptions using different models therefore remains wise. 
      And the same goes for allowing for policy variation across different regions, 
      in particular in the scenarios that fall short of achieving Net Zero emissions 
      by 2050.
      
      When thinking about the effects of the Disorderly transition risk scenarios 
      on the valuation of utility companies, it is important to first consider what 
      is already priced in. The greater the transition that is priced in, the lesser 
      the valuation up-lift one can expect from renewable-heavy utilities and the smaller 
      the impairment for carbon intensive utilities. Delayed Transition is more likely 
      than either Orderly or Divergent Net Zero, or Orderly Below 2&deg;C, because government 
      actions are currently (and expected to remain) well short of what is necessary for 
      these scenarios.
      
      Companies considering how to transition in ways consistent with Orderly 
      scenario pathways, and investors looking to encourage such transitions, 
      also need to account for the sector's diversity. Different strategies 
      will be appropriate for different firms to maintain revenues and minimise 
      the long-term financial impact. 
      
      Examples include expanding renewable energy development, investing in more 
      efficient thermal power generation and retiring low-efficient coal thermal 
      power generation, supporting the development of low carbon alternates to 
      natural gas, and increasing the weight of electricity in their portfolio.

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, the utility sector may benefit 
      from increased revenue as the global energy system becomes more electrified 
      but faces a rising carbon price which could increase production costs for 
      carbon intensive utilities without adequate transition plans.
    always: |
      The utilities sector would have a critical role to play in an Orderly 
      transition to either Net Zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, or a 
      Below 2&deg;C scenario. Orderly transition scenarios have two key features: 
      the decarbonisation of the global power and hence utilities sector; and 
      the electrification of energy usage in many other emitting sectors --- 
      like transportation and parts of industry --- as possible.
      
      The supporting pillars for the types of accelerated transitions envisaged 
      in the Orderly scenarios would involve radical changes in climate policy, 
      via significant increases in carbon prices, as well as much more stringent 
      regulatory 'command and control' policies. While the average utility company 
      could perform well under these scenarios, thanks largely to the demand 
      creation from electrification, there would be considerable dispersion of 
      impacts across firms, depending on the carbon intensity of their production 
      processes.

    high_materiality: |
      Changes in carbon pricing, electricity demand, the energy mix and energy prices 
      are likely to dominate financial impacts, with the extent dependant on how
      reliant the company's production/revenue mix is on low-carbon electricity
      and gas, the company's transition plans and how this compares to the sector
      average. For example:

      - **Increased revenue** for the utility sector as a whole as the global 
        energy system becomes more electrified, with revenue gains strongest for 
        zero and low carbon intensive utilities.
      
      - **Reduced revenue** for carbon intensive utilities as consumers switch
        to low carbon/electrified alternatives for heating and become more
        energy autonomous.

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions via tax or
        cap & trade clearing price, albeit with considerable dispersion in the 
        ability to pass carbon prices on to end-users depending on the carbon 
        intensity of a firm's operations.

      - **Readjusted capital expenditures** including new investments required
        to pivot business model towards renewable electricity generation.

      Risks are heavily concentrated in carbon intensive utilities that do not have 
      adequate transition plans, whilst opportunities exist for utilities drawing 
      most heavily on zero and low carbon activities. Capital investments into 
      fossil intensive electricity would significantly lag investment into 
      green electricity and storage.

      Nevertheless, in orderly transition scenarios, one has to be careful about also 
      expecting valuation uplifts in firms that act as 'pure plays' on an accelerated 
      energy transition, like Renewable Electricity Companies. That is because valuations 
      for that subset of firms are already high and arguably pricing in more aggressive 
      transition and decarbonisation scenarios. However, this is less of a constraint 
      in the Net Zero 2050 scenario because of the significance and rapidity of that transition. 
      
      Focusing on electricity generation capacity, solar and wind see the 
      largest absolute and relative increases in both the Net Zero 2050 and 
      Below 2&deg;C scenarios. Non-biomass renewables are then the third best 
      performer. In contrast the outlook for natural gas and especially coal 
      is much poorer, though there may be a more important role for natural 
      gas as a transition fuel, especially in the Below 2&deg;C scenario.

      Users also have to be aware that the results in this tool are derived 
      from one particular energy-systems model, which makes particular 
      assumptions about how the relative costs of different technologies are 
      likely to evolve over the longer-term. Even in Orderly transition scenarios, 
      the zero and low carbon 'winners' cannot be predicted with certainty. 
      The relative cost reductions and growth rates of solar and wind technologies, 
      government nuclear investment plans, and the viability of biomass, hydrogen 
      and carbon capture and storage technologies at greater scale are all highly 
      uncertain.
      
      These models also tend to place a low weight on the role of nascent 
      technologies. Because alternative assumptions about future technology 
      can generate vastly different usage patterns across the renewable and 
      fossil fuel types, users undertaking their own analyses should test the 
      sensitivity of their results to alternative models and assumptions.
      
      It should also be noted that this tool assumes that under a given scenario, 
      the required policies to achieve the necessary emissions trajectory are 
      applied evenly across all major emitting jurisdictions. While that is a 
      fair assumption under the Orderly scenario (because it cannot take place 
      without coordinated global action), in the slower Below 2&deg;C scenario, 
      different regional policy choice combinations are possible.
      
      Again, the user, where possible, should consider how policies directed at 
      the utility sector are likely to vary across jurisdictions as these have 
      the potential to significantly alter the results for particular utilities 
      and region/sector averages.
      
      Companies considering how to transition in ways consistent with Orderly 
      scenario pathways, and investors looking to encourage such transitions, 
      also need to account for the sector's diversity. Different strategies will 
      be appropriate for different firms to maintain revenues and minimise the 
      long-term financial impact. Examples include expanding renewable energy 
      development, investing in more efficient thermal power generation and 
      retiring low-efficient coal thermal power generation, supporting the 
      development of low carbon alternates to natural gas, and increasing the 
      weight of electricity in their portfolio.

      In high physical risk scenarios, extreme weather events could increase 
      disruption and cause damage to infrastructure, resulting in severe impacts 
      for the utilities sector as large proportion of the value of most utilities 
      is comprised of tangible (physical) capital.
    always: |
      High physical risk scenarios are those in which global policy makers do not 
      take sufficient steps to hold temperature increases below 2&deg;C. These in 
      turn can be decomposed into scenarios involving either slow rates of policy 
      change derived from countries' NDCs, or Current Policy scenarios in which there 
      is no policy change at all.
      
      The physical effects of climate change on utilities can be decomposed into the 
      chronic, such as raised sea-levels and acute changes in the frequency and severity 
      of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones and flooding. 
      These effects will definitionally be larger in high physical risk scenarios than low 
      physical risk scenarios, with significant disruptions to the utility sector. Effects 
      on profitability and valuations through this channel will be highly dependent on the 
      locational characteristics of the underlying assets. 

    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the utilities sector could be impacted in a 
      low physical risk scenario:
      
      **Chronic Impacts**:
      
      - **Higher average temperatures** could reduce demand for energy used for
        heating, particularly natural gas demand. Performance of combined-cycle
        power stations could decrease with an increase in temperature.
        
      - **Higher average sea levels** could render the existing locations of 
        some utilities unviable, particularly those that are in low-lying coastal 
        locations.
      
      **Acute Impacts**:
      
      - **More regular flooding, wildfires and other extreme weather events** 
        can cause water contamination, damage overhead powerlines and other 
        infrastructure, and disrupt operations. The utilities sector in particular 
        is especially susceptible to these events; a lot of generating infrastructure 
        is located in areas exposed to increased flooding risk as well as tropical 
        cyclone effects, and a large proportion of the value of most utilities is 
        comprised of tangible (physical) capital.
      
      There are many adaptation actions that companies can take to reduce the 
      physical risks mentioned above. These include, investing in resilient solutions 
      e.g. underground power line networks, disaster prevention systems (e.g. 
      vegetation management to keep tree limbs a safe distance from power lines) 
      and increase contribution of electricity businesses vs gas businesses. However, 
      adaptation becomes more difficult and costly, the greater the extent 
      of the temperature rises and climate change, especially as the consequences 
      become harder to predict.
      
      The most serious, sustained impacts on asset prices are likely to manifest later 
      in the scenario horizon. Indeed, standard discounting methods generate relatively 
      moderate negative effects on utility security valuations, though there is naturally 
      significant variation depending on their locational characteristics.
      
      It is also important to keep in mind that because the high physical risk 
      scenarios are also scenarios in which there is only an extremely slow energy 
      transition, the transitional risk effects on valuations will generally reverse 
      compared with the Orderly and Disorderly transition risk scenarios.
      
      For example, low-carbon intensive utilities could face valuation 
      impairments compared to current market prices rather than uplifts, while high-carbon 
      intensive utilities may see uplifts instead of impairments. This is 
      because markets are generally pricing in a faster energy transition than 
      implied by countries' NDCs, and particularly the maintenance of current policy.
      
      Again though there will very significant variation in these valuation effects 
      across regions as NDCs and current policy settings vary significantly across 
      different jurisdictions.

      Low physical risk scenarios capture all of the Orderly and Disorderly 
      transition risk scenarios that keep long-term temperature increases below 
      2&deg;C, with physical risks naturally being lowest, though not entirely 
      absent, in the or 1.5&deg;C scenarios (Net Zero 2050 and Divergent Net Zero).
      
      The physical effects of climate change on utilities can be decomposed into 
      the chronic, such as raised sea-levels and acute changes in the frequency 
      and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
      tropical cyclones and flooding. These effects will definitionally be smaller 
      in lower physical risk scenarios than high physical risk scenarios, but there 
      would still likely be disruptions to the utility sector, with effects on

      systems (e.g. vegetation management to keep tree limbs a safe distance
      from power lines) and increase contribution of electricity businesses vs
      gas businesses.
      
      Because the low physical risk scenarios are also the scenarios where significant 
      zero and low carbon energy transitions take place over the coming decades, for 
      most utility companies, physical effects in low physical risk scenarios are 
      likely to be swamped by transition effects.
      
      That is especially the case when the worse physical effects generally manifest 
      later than the transition effects and thus have a lower weight in most 
      valuation methods.
