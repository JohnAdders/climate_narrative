description: |
  The **Construction** sector includes establishments primarily responsible for
  the construction of buildings. The work performed may include new work,
  additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. The onsite assembly of
  pre-cut, panelised, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary
  buildings are also included in this sector. Establishments in this sector are
  classified based on the types of buildings they construct. The construction 
  sector includes companies that are, for example, involved in the following:

  1. The construction of residential and commercial buildings. This also
     includes remodelling or renovating work for the buildings.

  1. The construction of distribution lines and related buildings and structures
     for utilities (i.e. water, sewer, petroleum, gas, power, and communication)
     or the structures that are integral parts of the utility systems (power
     plants, sewer lines, oil and gas pipelines, telecommunications
     transmitting/receiving towers, etc.)

  1. The construction of highways (including elevated), streets, roads, airport
     runways, public sidewalks, bridges, and other heavy and civil engineering
     constructions.

  1. The installation or servicing of equipment that is part of building
     mechanical systems such as plumbing, heating, electrical wiring, etc.

      In Delayed/Divergent transition risk scenarios, the construction sector could 
      face rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase building material 
      and energy prices, as well as falling asset values as current infrastructure 
      becomes increasingly obsolete.

      In Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, the demand for
      construction is likely to increase. The construction sector was
      responsible for 13% of global GDP in 2020, and this share is expected to
      increase as the global population continues to rise. However, the
      Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios could also lead to a
      reduction in GDP growth. This could partially offset growth in demand for
      the construction sector.

      While the construction sector could continue to play a role in meeting
      customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy
      generation in the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late policy
      action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis
      brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing
      until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon prices are
      increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the Divergent
      scenario there is a more immediate but divergent reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both these scenarios are likely to have a
      significant impact on the profitability of this sector; constructing
      assets such as buildings, roads, railways, tunnels and bridges involves
      emitting carbon, primarily through electricity use, fuel usage for
      vehicles and plant, and from the production of materials, such as steel
      and cement. As per Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (Global
      ABC) report, in 2020, the Buildings and Construction sector accounted for
      36% of global energy consumption.

      The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and
      energy mix could potentially result in one or more of the following
      financial impacts:

      - **Reduced Revenues** Negative public sentiment around sustainability and
        climate change issues can affect all the value chain players leading to
        reduced demand for products and services.

      - **Disruptive increase in costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions
        directly or indirectly through expensive conventional building material
        or non-renewable energy for its operations. Due to delayed actions, the
        emission intensity of construction processes could have a limited scope
        of improvement.

      - **Increased capital expenditures** New investments could be required to
        improve the energy efficiency of the construction process including but
        not limited to using fewer or different materials, employing different
        production techniques, using lower emission transportation, optimizing
        transportation routes, planning fewer journeys, minimising the use of
        non-renewable grid energy and recycling.

      - **Increased R&D investments** could be needed to explore alternative
        construction processes and materials to improve the emission intensity.

      - **Falling asset values** impairment of the economic value of company
        assets such as outdated machinery and material transportation vehicles
        with poor energy efficiency.

      In Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, the construction sector
      is likely to be impacted by rapid decarbonization in building materials
      and its own operations. Likely reduction in the production of cement due
      to higher carbon tax amid increasing global demand could drive the price
      of cement more than 500% higher by 2050 in the Divergent Net Zero scenario
      and over 400% higher by 2050 in the Delayed transition scenario, leading
      to increased material cost for the construction industry.

      The construction sector is also likely to be impacted by rapid
      decarbonization in energy mix. Increased carbon tax cost and new
      investment for renewables could increase the electricity cost for the
      construction industry in the short-to-medium term.

      The construction sector is also likely to be impacted by rapid decarbonization
      in transport. Within road freight vehicles, the portion of electric
      vehicles could increase between 30% and 75% by 2050 in Disorderly/Divergent
      transition risk scenarios.

      The profitability of the construction sector, in the Disorderly/Divergent
      transition risk scenarios, could also depend on the relevant companies
      proactively investing in innovation and new technology. It is critical
      that energy efficiency improves in design and construction, as well as in
      the operations of buildings. It is estimated that the total GHG emissions
      from building material is largely concentrated in just 10 commonly used
      items: Cement, Steel, Limestone, Structural clay, Aluminium, etc.
      Decarbonising steel and concrete production currently represent a
      significant challenge. The alternative is to substitute such materials,
      where possible, for lower-carbon intensity products, and increase
      recycling.

      While the construction sector could continue to play a role in meeting

      generation in Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate
      policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon

      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price. These

      The construction sector is likely to be impacted by steady decarbonization
      in building materials and its own operations. Among building materials,
      cement could incur the most impact due to its limited capacity to improve
      CO<sub>2</sub> intensity and increasing carbon price. A sharper focus
      would be required for the cement industry to improve its clinker-to-cement
      ratio and deploy carbon storage technologies.

      Likely reduction in the production of cement due to higher carbon tax amid
      increasing global demand could drive the price of cement more than 350%
      higher by 2050 in the Net Zero 2050 scenario and over 250% higher by 2050
      in the Below 2&deg;C scenario, leading to increased material cost for the
      construction industry.

      decarbonization in energy mix. By 2050, renewables and biomass would cover
      68% of global primary energy needs. The increased carbon tax cost and new
      investment for renewables could increase the electricity cost for the

      In high physical risk scenarios, both the severity and frequency of physical 
      risk events are expected to increase exponentially, resulting in severe impacts 
      for the construction sector.
    always: |
      The construction sector is one of the most exposed sectors to physical
      impacts of climate change, chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and
      acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events
      such as heatwaves, winds, storms and flooding. Whilst the construction
      industry is used to responding to and managing changing weather
      conditions, in high physical risk scenarios, global warming could increase
      the weather variations, and both the severity and frequency of physical
      risk events are expected to increase exponentially. This could lead to
      physical damages to buildings as well as disruption to the construction
      process, which may decrease profitability for the construction industry.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
      over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for
      construction.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the construction sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Rising sea levels** could cause disruption to the construction process
        and can also lead to reduced demand in particular markets and locations
        such as in coastal areas.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Heatwaves** can stop work on construction projects for health and
        safety reasons while also potentially compromising the structural
        integrity of the materials, causing machinery malfunctions, and
        increasing fire risk. In the Current Policies scenario, mean air 
        temperatures, as well as mean daily minimum and maximum air 
        temperatures, are projected to increase significantly.

      - **High winds and storms** are known to be a risk to construction.
        Tropical cyclones are likely becoming more intense leading to
        construction timelines getting extended or disrupted.

      - **Heavy precipitation and flooding** can cause significant damage to
        project sites with infrastructure collapsing and exposed materials
        getting damaged. In the current policies scenario, precipitation is 
        expected to increase significantly.

      Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for
      construction through its effect on individuals' disposable income and
      government spending.

      There are many mitigating actions companies can take against the physical
      risks mentioned above. For example, increasing the durability of materials
      against extreme weather conditions, improved drainage systems and better
      equipment to be able to withstand stronger cyclones, a more robust design
      of infrastructure and stricter construction standards. To reduce the
      impact of rising sea levels, the position of new facilities should
      consider climate change to minimise the risk of total damage caused by
      flooding.
