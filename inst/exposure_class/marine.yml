name: Marine Underwriting Class
test_report_position: 13
description: |
  The **marine** underwriting class is one of the oldest classes of insurance
  business. It involves insuring companies engaging in economic activity
  relating to the oceans, rivers, and the Great Lakes. This includes traditional
  maritime activities such as designing, constructing, manufacturing, supplying,
  maintaining vessels or parts, operating and managing shipping lines, and
  crewing ships. It also includes engaging in maritime law, customs services,
  fishing operations, marine science, salvage operations and the operation of
  ports, shipyards, drydocks, and cruise lines.

  Typical marine insurance policies provide cover for physical loss or damage,
  split across hull (covering damage to the vessel, propulsion machinery and
  equipment used for activities such as cargo handling), cargo (loss or damage
  to freight), fine art and specie (high-value goods), liability (including
  personal injuries, pollution and collision) and yacht insurance.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the marine sector could 
      be impacted by an increase in carbon price through fuel cost, falling 
      asset values as older inefficient vessels becomes increasingly obsolete, 
      and lower demand as consumers become more conscious of the environmental 
      impacts of their purchases. This is likely to have an impact on the profitability 
      of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms 
      and conditions, and coverage.
    always: |
      While the marine sector could continue to play a role in facilitating
      global trade and meeting customer demand for the coming years, the
      changing patterns in energy generation in the Delayed transition scenario,
      driven by late policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of
      the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 to
      compensate for the inaction beforehand. The Divergent Net Zero scenario
      results in immediate but divergent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions.
      Both these scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability of
      this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products' pricing
      and coverage.

      These scenarios could also lead to a limited reduction in GDP growth. This 
      could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the marine sector.
    high_materiality: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the impact on the
      marine underwriting class could depend on the increases in carbon and
      energy prices and how reliant the marine company's revenue mix is on
      low-carbon electricity and bunker fuel and how it compares to the sector
      average. For example:

      - **Increased operating costs of the underlying companies to be insured
        could impact their demand for insurance.** The increase in carbon and
        energy prices could potentially result in financial impacts, as marine
        firms' carbon emissions face a rising price in the form a carbon tax or
        cap & trade clearing price, particularly for shipping firms using
        fossil-based bunker fuel.
        
        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the price per gigajoule 
        of liquid final energy (liquid fuels from all energy sources; incl. oil 
        products, synthetic fossil fuels from gas and coal, biofuels) for use in 
        transportation increases from ~30 USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) 
        to ~50 USD in the Delayed transition scenario, and to ~55 USD in the Divergent 
        Net Zero scenario, by 2050.

      - Firms could have to keep up with the diverse or rapidly changing
        regulations across jurisdictions in which they operate, leading to
        **increasing compliance requirements.** These changes may require firms
        to adapt their service, potentially reducing sales (e.g.
        efficiency-based speed limits for Cruise ships leading to a less
        appealing service with reduced itinerary and more sea days) and could
        lead to changes in the level and type of insurance coverage required.

      - **Asset valuation of marine company reserves could be re-priced** based
        on the re-adjusted expectations of the use of low-carbon products and
        energy efficient technologies in the future. Failure to use low-carbon
        products and energy efficient technologies could affect the commercial
        reputation of the company and could lead to loss in customers and
        decrease in revenue.

      - **Changing consumer preferences**, these could lead to changes in sales
        due to lower customer demand as a result of change in environmental
        expectations that could impact this underwriting class. Consumer's
        acceptance of firms' products can also affect sales (e.g. 'planetary
        diets' reducing demand for animal-based products, including fish).

      There is also significant dependence of other sectors on the services of
      the marine sector, mainly in regard to transportation which plays a key
      role in other firms' supply chains. This magnifies the importance of
      decarbonising the marine sector as companies who have a high carbon step
      in their supply chain could lose customers as consumer preferences change
      \- without decarbonisation of the marine sector, consumers may prefer local
      alternative goods which rely less on international transportation. This
      could decrease demand for the marine sector.

      The profitability of the marine sector and its associated underwriting
      class, in the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, could also
      depend on the relevant companies proactively investing in innovation and
      new technology. For example:

      - Efficiency increasing shipping methods (e.g. containerization)

      - Energy efficient vessels and vessel modifications (e.g. Silverstream air
        lubrication, sensor-controlled cabin lighting)

      - 'Smart ports' which enhance co-ordination between ship and port call
        activities to optimise voyage speeds

      - Alternatives to fossil-based bunker fuels (e.g. biodiesel, methanol,
        lignin, and Ammonia). In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, 
        sources of final energy used in the transport sector change dramatically. 
        As use of oil declines, electricity becomes the dominant source of final 
        energy by the end of the century.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, these innovations 
      could contribute to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
      in the transportation sector.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios also present opportunities 
      for the marine sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations could 
      lead to positive gains in commercial reputation
      and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could
      proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green strategy.
      Disclosing comparable climate alignment metrics for marine insurance
      portfolios in accordance with a global framework, such as the Poseidon
      Principles, could allow consumers to easily identify firms making progress
      in alignment with their green strategy.

      The marine sector could continue to play a role in facilitating global
      trade and meeting customer demand for the coming years. The changing
      patterns in energy generation in Orderly transition scenarios,
      driven by immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy
      strategies, and carbon legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth
      reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon
      price.

      These are likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and

      - International cooperation could spur changes in maritime law leading to
        **increasing compliance requirements**. These changes may require firms
        to adapt their service, potentially reducing sales (e.g.

      The marine sector and its associated underwriting class are highly exposed 
      to high physical risk scenarios due to the projected increase in weather 
      variation and being subject to increasing disruption. This is likely to have 
      an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the associated 
      insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage. 
    always: |
      The marine sector and its associated underwriting class are exposed to
      physical risk. Chronic (e.g. raised sea-levels and global mean
      temperatures) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity
      of weather events such as flooding and cyclones, which could
      cause significant disruption to services and damage to infrastructure, and
      lead to an increase in operating costs (as operations become largely
      reactive to remediate issues), a decrease in production capacity, and
      interruption of the supply chain.

      Physical risks could also impact employment as well as potentially lead to
      a decline in revenue due to rising transportation times and inability to
      meet customer demands. Whilst the marine sector is used to responding to
      and managing changing weather conditions, in the low physical risk
      scenario, climate change and global warming could increase weather
      variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to marine sector
      which could impact the profitability for these companies and therefore
      could impact the marine underwriting class as the physical effects of
      climate change could result in increased claims and increased premiums
      potentially resulting in some marine underwriting class' risks becoming
      either uninsurable or unaffordable.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these vary in line with different temperatures projected for 
      each scenario. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact marine sector demand.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the marine sector and underwriting
      class could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      - **Cyclones, storms and strong winds** are likely to have a significant
        effect and can cause damage to infrastructure and cargo spills

      - **Extreme temperatures** are likely to reduce productivity of fish farms
        through its effect on harvest weight, harvest volume, mortality, and
        frequency of algae blooms.

      - **Sea level rise** can damage port infrastructure and in turn severely
        disrupt operations of marine firms who rely on port services.

      Significantly slowed GDP growth could impact marine sector demand through
      its effect on individuals' disposable income, which results in lower
      spending on private boats and goods transported on water.

      There are a number of mitigating actions these companies can take against
      the high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into their
      operations against extreme weather events. For example, set standards for
      rough sea conditions for cancellation of maritime navigation, coordinate
      with weather information providers and adhere to their navigation
      suggestions, increase the service life of containers and other
      infrastructure likely to be damaged in extreme weather, and consider sea
      water temperature profiles when planning new fish farm sites.
