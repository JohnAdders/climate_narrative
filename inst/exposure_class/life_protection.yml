name: Life Protection
description: |
  The **Life Protection** underwriting class covers term assurance, whole life
  assurance, mortgage protection, income protection and critical illness written
  on either an individual or group basis.

  Life assurance policies generally pay out a one-off payment of the cover
  amount on death of the life assured. Policies may be written on whole of life
  basis, or cover may last for a specified term. The cover amount can be flat
  over the term of the policy or may decrease over the policy duration.

  Critical illness policies provide the pay out on the occurrence of one of a
  set of predetermined conditions. Depending on the definition, payment may
  occur on diagnosis, when the condition has progressed to a specified severity
  or when certain treatments are performed.

  Income protection provides a regular income for policyholders who are unable
  to work due to illness or injury. Payments may last until the policyholder
  recovers or may be for a predetermined length of time. The main risks covered
  by Life Protection businesses for consumers are mortality and morbidity. The
  other key risks life protection businesses are exposed to are expenses, lapses
  and catastrophes.

      Life Protection underwriting exposures could be impacted in the Disorderly 
      transition risk scenarios, as mortality and morbidity could be affected by 
      both a reduction in pollution which could in turn result in a reduction in 
      cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke as well as 
      potentially a decrease in healthcare spending. 
    always: |
      Life Protection underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition
      effects related to changes in pollution levels. In Disorderly
      transition risk scenarios, the Delayed transition driven by a late policy
      action enables a "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis
      brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing
      until 2030 and a decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to
      compensate for the inaction beforehand. The Divergent scenario results in
      an immediate by divergent reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This
      could lead to a significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050,
      probably associated with a drive towards cleaner air (due to for example,
      an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal
      combustion engines). This would cause a reduction in pollution which could
      in turn result into a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory
      diseases, heart attack and stroke.

      These scenarios could also lead to a limited reduction in GDP growth. This 
      could lead to significant changes in the rate of growth in healthcare spending 
      that could negatively impact mortality and morbidity.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing
      greenhouse gases could probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner
      air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important
      to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as
      CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) that lead to warming but do not
      directly impact health, and the production of pollutants (such as
      particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx)) that are more directly harmful
      to health.
      
      In these scenarios, emissions of hazardous pollutants, for example 
      black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of nitrogen, 
      are projected to decrease. Emission trajectories for oxides of nitrogen 
      (NOx) can be seen here, but other hazardous pollutants in the NGFS could 
      equally be referenced as a guide as these have broadly similar trajectories.

      Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with
      advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars are replaced with
      electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable
      sources), some climate outcomes may achieve one and not the other. For
      example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning this may reduce greenhouse effect but
        actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      - If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK)
        but without global buy-in, then this could also reduce the correlation.

      In the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, there is potential
      for fewer deaths and a positive outcome for health relating to air
      pollution, the reduction of pollution could result into a reduction of
      cancers (especially lung) and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma,
      respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
      respiratory tract infections, but also cardiovascular disease ), although
      we note that this is very much dependent on the fuel mix generating
      electrical power for the grid. For example, whilst waste-to-energy plants
      have similar particulate outputs to gas-fired power stations, biomass
      plants such as wood pellet fired facilities, for their many positives,
      produce significantly more particulates than gas-fired power stations
      (Hajat et al., 2014).

      **GDP growth effect**

      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more
      on factors that can impact the nation's health and thus indirectly levels
      of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on
      how government and society chose to allocate any GDP growth.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could lead to a
      moderate to severe fall in GDP growth. A slower GDP growth would
      potentially constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social
      care, medical research etc. Assuming that greater funding is correlated to
      some extent with mortality and morbidity outcomes, this means any climate
      scenario could have an impact on mortality and morbidity via its impact on
      GDP.

      This could impact across the range of protection products. Although the
      precise impact may differ between products depending on the scenario (for
      example, income protection claims experience might suffer more if there
      was a reduction in spending on musculoskeletal conditions, whilst critical
      illness would be more sensitive to trajectories in cancer diagnosis
      techniques), it may be more appropriate to view this at the "overall"
      level rather than spuriously defining specific GDP allocation scenarios.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, the
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios could have an impact on the
      pricing of life protection products, although this is likely to be modest.

      Life Protection underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition
      effects related to changes in pollution levels. In Orderly

      immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, and
      this would probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner air (due to
      for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with
      internal combustion engines). This would cause a reduction in pollution
      which could in turn result into a reduction in cancer (especially lung),
      respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke.

      The Orderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a limited

      In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in 
      increased disruption that could have an impact on the life protection 
      underwriting class, as mortality and morbidity could be affected by both a 
      reduction in healthcare spending and an increase in a myriad of health 
      problems due to higher temperatures.
    always: |
      In the high physical risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in
      increased disruption that could have an impact on the life protection
      underwriting class. Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average
      temperatures and rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute
      effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events
      (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could
      impact mortality and morbidity risks, although this is dependent on
      location and may not be as material in the UK. This could result in future
      prospective policyholders becoming more expensive to insure.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
      over time. The high physical risk scenario could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact mortality and
      morbidity.

      **GDP growth effect**

      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more
      on factors that can impact the nation's health and thus indirectly levels
      of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on
      how government and society chose to allocate any GDP growth. However,
      higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending
      on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is
      reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater "on
      average" if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how
      spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP
      would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas.
      Assuming that greater funding is correlated to some extent with mortality
      and morbidity outcomes, this means any climate scenario could have an
      impact on mortality and morbidity via its impact on GDP.

      This could impact across the range of protection products. Although the
      precise impact may differ between products depending on the scenario (for
      example, income protection claims experience might suffer more if there

      techniques), it may be more appropriate to view this at the "overall"
      level rather than spuriously defining specific GDP allocation scenarios.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      In a high physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate effects
      such as temperature variation and weather events could pose significant
      challenges that in turn could impact the life protection underwriting
      class. For example:

      - **Mortality**: A level increase in temperature in the UK could lead to a
        reduction in deaths since the reduction in excess deaths due to cold
        weather may outweigh any increase excess deaths due to warmer weather
        and the risk of prolonged heat waves. However, to the extent that any
        increase in temperatures comes with an increase in the variability of
        temperatures, we could see an increase in both Winter and Summer excess
        mortality. In addition, the impact is not the same for all ages, with
        children and older people likely to be the most affected - given that
        life assurance is predominantly bought by people of working age, the
        exposure to higher mortality for children and older people is likely to
        be more limited.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer, a condition often covered by critical
        illness products. The prevalence of skin cancer is dependent on
        geographic location so any increased prevalence may also differ by
        location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could lead to higher critical illness
        claims or income protection claims.

      In the Current Policies scenario, mean air temperatures, as well as mean 
      daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, are projected to increase.

      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality and morbidity, the low
      physical risk scenario could have an impact on the pricing of life
      protection products.

      There are several mitigating actions that could be taken against the
      potential mortality and morbidity impacts due to the physical risks
      mentioned above to build resiliency against extreme weather events. For
      example, investing in more resilient solutions for heating/cooling
      technologies across homes and businesses, as well as integrating climate
      change into the medical curriculum to better equip health professionals in
      the face of climate change driven emergencies and extreme weather events.
