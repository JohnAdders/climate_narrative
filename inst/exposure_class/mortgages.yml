name: Mortgage Lending Exposure
description: |
  **Mortgages** are a lending exposure type based upon a legal agreement by
  which a bank, building society or other regulated organisation lends money at
  interest in exchange for taking title of the customer's property, with the
  condition that the conveyance of title becomes void upon the payment of the
  debt. Thus, it is a secured loan against the title of a residential property.

  Mortgages are normally lent to individuals (sometimes companies) and the
  amount borrowed is based upon the affordability of the applicants, either on a
  capital repayment or interest only basis (it is worth noting that for buy to
  let mortgages the rental income is used to define loan amount). The main types
  are mortgage lending in the residential sector are:

  - Standard owner occupier

  - Buy to let

  - Later life or equity release

      Lending on residential property remains a key focus and the UK housing
      market is a strategic cornerstone to continue to support the UK economy,
      with it being expected that supply could outstrip demand for the
      foreseeable future. The quality of residential stock could be the key
      challenge on the mortgage lending sector.

      In Disorderly transitional risk scenarios, the changes in energy prices
      are material as they impact every property and are applied throughout the
      period. These have the ability to account for the greatest proportion of
      losses, after the macroeconomic impact has been forecast.

      Transition risk also has the ability to generate significant losses due to
      the cost of retrofitting (if not Government funded) and through properties
      that are unable to meet the minimum Efficiency Performance Certificate
      (EPC) standard and hence are classified as unmarketable (and
      unmortgageable).

      **Abrupt and steep phase in of carbon/ emissions prices**

      Increasing energy prices, due to the Government carbon taxes or elevated
      energy costs, impacts both homeowners' and renters' ability to repay debt
      over an extended period of time. The potentially enduring nature of this
      shock (as oppose to the one-off costs associated with, say, retrofitting),
      and the broader impact (i.e. it affects nearly all to some extent) leads
      to a greater effect than that experienced as a result of retrofitting. The
      reduced ability to pay, as a result of more income being spent on energy
      bills, could increase probabilities of default.
      
      In Delayed/Divergent scenarios, electricity price increases in the short 
      term, peaking around 2035 in the Delayed transition scenario and 2030 in 
      the Divergent Net Zero scenario. Oil and gas prices increase throughout, 
      both more than tripling by 2050 in the Delayed transition scenario, and 
      more than doubling by 2050 in the Divergent Net Zero scenario.

      **Uncertainty about implementation of transition policies**

      The lack of certainty over transition policies leads to supressed action
      amongst consumers given the uncertainty of the need to act, the best
      courses of action to take if they do wish to act, and any potential
      financial support available. This uncertainty also limits the development
      of capacity within the supply chain and the training of skilled persons to
      carry out the work. The output of that is more properties being impacted
      value wise by not meeting regulation or unskilled contractors attempting
      to retrofit which actually damages the property.

      **EPC**

      Given that all mortgage lending is linked to properties, any legislation
      that impacts them or requires change can have an impact on the market and
      the value. The EPC changes that could be required in a transition scenario
      could impact Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and
      property value.

      Currently proposed legislation is:

      - EPC C for private rented property by 2025 (new tenancies)

      - EPC C for private rented property by 2028 (existing tenancies)

      - EPC C for residential property by 2035

      - Portfolio average of EPC Band C by 2030

      - All property Net Zero by 2050

      The introduction of the above legislation generates one or more of the
      below financial risks, especially if lenders are targeted with improving
      the energy performance of their book on an annual basis:

      - The impact on the value of the property if it can't be retrofitted

      - Cost of improving the property to EPC standard required (c70% of
        properties could need to be retrofitted to achieve EPC C)

      - Increased impairments and arrears: increased voids in tenancy/landlord
        fines

      - Landlords exiting the buy to let market in certain locations where the
        rental yield doesn't justify the cost of retrofitting

      - Credit worthiness of customers: potential mortgage prisoners

      - Potential impact on securitisation/covered bond and BoE collateral,
        minimum EPC or increased haircut for below EPC C properties

      - Increasing competition for EPC A/B properties and the impact this has on
        mortgage pricing

      - Potential liability and conduct risk from green propositions sold and
        incorrectly provided / assumed advice

      - Risk from underperformance of third parties recommended by the lender to
        support retrofitting activity

      - Contagion from third-party suppliers due to their carbon footprint

      - Changes in consumer expectations relating to prioritisation of green
        strategic objectives

      - Carbon footprint of products and services impacting consumer and
        employee attraction and retention

      - Inability to deliver a just transition leading to vulnerable or
        least-able-to-pay customers being disadvantaged

      In Delayed/Divergent scenarios, emissions from residential and commercial 
      buildings are projected to fall due to increased efficiency from new 
      legislation (as well as a change in energy mix).

      For lenders who have a material exposure to mortgages, they are likely to
      be their largest source of carbon emissions, so there is a heavy reliance
      on accurate energy efficiency and/or consumption data to calculate
      financed emissions.

      Whilst EPCs have their limitations (only approximately half of most
      mortgage portfolios have one, only 50% of UK properties have one, limited
      validity period of 10-years, only required on build, sale and rental of a
      property, no requirement to update following improvements, assessor
      biases, focus on building efficiency rather than energy usage), they still
      remain the best most available source of energy performance data for UK
      housing. As a result, they form the main data set to calculate and set any
      potential science-based targets for mortgage books. There is also an
      acknowledgement from Government that the EPC methodology needs to be
      updated to reflect carbon emissions and not just cost.

      Lenders with material exposures to mortgages could need to address any
      data gaps through the development of models using artificial intelligence
      and machine learning algorithms, and the characteristics of a property
      that does not have an EPC, to estimate its EPC rating and other factors.

      **Additional risks**

      There are some additional risks that those with material exposures should
      consider:

      - Carbon footprint of products and services impacting consumer and
        employee attraction and retention

      - Reputational damage due to service failures resulting from transitional
        risk impacting service capacity and/or increased customer activity (for
        example, increased call volumes)

      - Reputational risk impact of lending on a property which subsequently
        requires retrofitting and whether there is the perception that as a
        lender, they should protect the borrower from this risk. This risk is
        further elevated where scenario modelling indicated the potential risk
        but this was not conveyed to the borrower

      - Reputational risk associated with missing green / Net Zero targets /
        commitments as a result of inadequate government support

      **Opportunities**

      - Influencing future policy -working with government and other parties to
        ensure a just transition to greener mortgages.

      - New propositions: develop new products to support the financing and/or
        provision of retrofitting and physical risk reducing solutions, such as
        further advances or mortgage drawdown products linked directly to
        improvements in EPC ratings, interest rollup products to fund
        retrofitting and / or asset finance to support retrofitting such as
        solar panels.

      - Customer engagement: support the consumer in improving their
        environmental credentials.

      - Product (primarily mortgage) pricing linked to the energy efficiency or
        physical risk rating of the property.

      - Products aimed at supporting the transition of the Housing Association
        sector (e.g., Sustainable Linked Loans)
        
      In Delayed/Divergent scenarios, lenders with exposures to mortgage books 
      should also look to assess the strategic risk caused by the emissions of 
      their mortgage lending. This could be driven from targets and commitments 
      previously set or imposed by regulators. Lenders could use the Partnership 
      Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), as recommended by the Taskforce Climate 
      Financial Disclosure, to model the emissions across their mortgage portfolio. 
      Lenders could also assess their ability to decarbonise their lending 
      portfolio in line with the sector's decarbonisation pathway. This analysis 
      begins the feedback loop of climate scenario analysis into future strategy.

      The mortgage market has the potential to be one of the most exposed
      sectors to physical impacts of climate change due to changes to frequency
      and severity of coastal erosion, subsidence, and weather events such as 
      tropical cyclones and flooding.

      The mortgage market doesn't have the experience of responding to and
      managing changing weather conditions (as this is often covered by if a
      property is insurable), in the high physical risk scenario, climate change
      and global warming could increase weather variations.

      If high physical risks become a common factor, there could be a skew of
      lending towards properties less prone to physical risks and could result
      in certain segments in the property market being blighted given their risk
      profile.

      There would be opportunities for those best able to assess these risks,
      and hence willing to lend to segments of the markets that others are not,
      albeit at higher rates to account for the risk.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the mortgage sector could be
      impacted in a low physical risk scenario and potential considerations at
      mortgage origination that firms might not review today:

      - **Tropical cyclones or storms** should be considered when reviewing
        acceptable construction types and the nature of insurance that is
        available given the potential damage to property and impact on market
        value.

      - **Flooding events** which could pose risks to property value and damage
        through coastal, river or surface water flooding. It needs to be
        considered if the property is only insurable due to FloodRe and what
        happens when that ends, along with if flood defences can resolve the
        issue. The number of times a property floods is a key consideration. 
        In the Current Policies scenario, there is a fifteen-fold increase in 
        the fraction of land annually exposed to river floods by the end of the 
        century, to ~0.075%.

      - **Subsidence** is currently an issue that is covered by insurance but if
        it becomes more prevalent it could impact property values due to the
        cost of remediation. The age, construction and location of the property
        needs to be considered when reviewing risks.

      - **Coastal Erosion** is a significant issue as without the correct
        coastal management plan the property could end up as a worthless asset
        having fallen into the sea or there is a severe haircut due to cash only
        purchasers.

      When reviewing the above physical risks the following issues should be
      considered:

      - Asset value of the property

      - Increased impairments and arrears: increased voids in tenancy/insurance
        premiums/cost of repair if insurance is unavailable

      - Credit worthiness of customers: potential mortgage prisoners

      - Increasing competition for lower-risk properties

      - Reputational risk impact of lending on a property which subsequently
        requires retrofitting/flooded/subsided/eroded and whether there is the
        perception that as a lender, they should protect the borrower from this
        risk

      - The potential conduct risk where scenario modelling indicated the
        potential risk but this was not conveyed to the borrower and what
        products/services/advice should be given

      - External factors such as FloodRe which if they change during the
        mortgage term could have a significant impact on the value of the
        property

      - Does the lender have the internal expertise to be able to understand the
        physical risks and set appropriate polices and risk tolerances

      - In high-risk scenarios additional flooding combined with FloodRe ending
        means these properties become uninsurable, as insurers refuse to take on
        the risk which creates a severe impact on value.

      - Coastal erosion has the potential to be the most material physical risk,
        as while it impacts a relatively small number of properties the unit
        level of loss is extreme, albeit still low.
