  Sovereign (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to
  support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the
  bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of
  coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. The government bond
  sector is a broad category that includes "sovereign" debt, which is issued and
  generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, German
  Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and
  Government of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government
  bonds. The US, Japan and Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in
  the government bond market.

  Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation,
  known as inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected
  Securities (TIPS). On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal
  is adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in the rate of inflation,
  thus providing a "real," or inflation-adjusted, return. But, unlike other
  bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when real
  interest rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.

  In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes
  subcomponents, such as:

  - Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various
    goals - supporting affordable housing or the development of small
    businesses, for example - through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to
    support their operations. Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central
    government while others are not. Supranational organisations, like the World
    Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
    finance public projects and/or development.

  - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or
    cities - borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools,
    as well as general operations. The market for local government bonds is well
    established in the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other
    developed markets also issue provincial/local government bonds.

  In this paper we refer to a '20-notch' sovereign bond rating scale translated from
  S&P's alphabetical standardized rating scale (see Appendix), which is used to outline 
  changes to sovereign bond ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. 
  Impacts of climate change on sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference 
  to the 2021 working paper titled "Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The 
  Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness" from the University of
  Cambridge. This study represents one approach towards quantifying the effects
  of climate change on credit ratings and is illustrative based on a
  hypothetical model. It is not predictive and broader literature on this topic
  is also available.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, delayed or divergent policy 
      reaction, societal change and national energy strategies could lead to 
      significant increases in carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
      sovereign bonds in particular in countries with a strong level of dependence 
      on fossil fuel energy sources.
    always: |
      In the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action enables a
      "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19.
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030 before policies drive a
      sharp decrease after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. This
      results in smaller increases in carbon taxes compared to Orderly
      transition risk scenarios until 2030, but significantly higher carbon taxes
      thereafter as countries attempt to make up lost ground. In the Divergent
      Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to
      occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

      These scenarios could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in
      countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.
      Industries that are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as
      mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel
      demand and increased costs from significantly higher carbon taxes.

      On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment)
      could encourage consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables,
      energy efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading to increases in fiscal
      revenues. The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a reduction in
      GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on Indian sovereign bonds.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with
      carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the
      most vulnerable to transition risk. 
      
      The impact of Disorderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely 
      dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate 
      these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more environmentally 
      friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns can help economies 
      transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy could 
      lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the respective country's 
      size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, such as 
      carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms' profitability, 
      which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
      [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf){target="\_blank"}).
      
      India has been reducing their share of global coal power development; however, 
      India still remains the second largest coal pipeline globally and has over 200 GW 
      of coal-fired capacity in operation (a share of 11% of global capacity). There is 
      a significant risk that India's coal infrastructure will become stranded assets, 
      especially when considering that two thirds of India's coal-fired power plants 
      were built in the last 10 years.
      
      India's installed capacity of renewables stands at over 118 GW as at September 2022,  
      double their 2016 capacity (Central Elecetricity Authority of India, 2022). 
      This includes 58 GW of solar and 41 GW of wind energy, with net capacity additions of 12.4 GW 
      of solar and 3.2 GW of onshore wind between 2019 and 2021. Solar and wind have become the 
      lowest-cost electricity sources in India, even without a subsidy.
      
      The share of renewables in India's electricity generation mix has been increasing since 2015, 
      and was just over 20% in 2020, but still remains below the world average.

      [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/){target="\_blank"}
      
      India's Draft National Electricity Plan 2022 highlights that India is planning to add 333GW 
      of solar and 134GW of wind capacity by 2031-32, which would result in an increase of 6 and 3 
      times 2021-22 capacity levels, respectively.
      
      India's policy direction towards achieving a phase down of coal is still unclear. On the one hand
      India is considering a proposal to halt construction of new coal-based power units, on the other 
      hand the government is continuing its support for coal in various forms. The government is also 
      planning to increase the share of fossil gas in the primary energy mix and is approving the 
      development of new gas infrastructure.
      
      An accelerated transition away from coal towards renewable energy in line with the 
      Paris Agreement would come with large benefits for sustainable development, with 
      increased employment, avoiding health impacts from air pollution, reducing imports 
      from fossil fuels, and benefits for the environment avoiding impacts on water and 
      biodiversity and reducing climate change damages.
      
      **GDP growth effect**

      A change in a country's GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal
      revenue it receives. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease
      in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates
      from the NGFS, disorderly transition could result in significant GDP
      losses. In these scenarios, world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition 
      effects are estimated to be between -4.6% and -4.7% (relative to a baseline with no 
      transition or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP impacts from transition risks are 
      negative as the speed of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and 
      affects consumption and investment.  
      
      In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and transition risks in 2050. 
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Disorderly 
      scenario on India's GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, ranging from -4.9% 
      to -6.6% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

      **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. No
      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces,
      although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have
      implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 "Rising
      Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign
      Creditworthiness" working paper from the University of Cambridge, in
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios, most developed countries would be
      marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among
      top-rated countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related
      risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top
      ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. 
      
      According to the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, India would have a downgrade above one 
      notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the Indian government by approximately 
      US$1.61-2.41bn.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Based on the IIASA NGFS
      Climate Scenarios, REMIND model by 2050, in Orderly transition risk
      scenarios, fossil fuels represent only ~25% to ~40% of global energy demand
      compared to ~85% in 2020. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as
      oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition
      risk.

      The impact from the Orderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues
      is largely dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to
      mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more
      environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption
      patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly
      managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity.

      energy sectors, green policies, such as carbon taxes would impact,
      positively or negatively, firms' profitability, which would, in turn,

      by 2050. World GDP impacts from transition risk are moderately negative in the Net Zero 2050
      scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are only 
      partially offset by the recycling of carbon revenues into government investment and lower 
      employment taxes.
      
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of an 
      Orderly transition risk scenario on India's GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would

      In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP
      growth due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural
      resources, lower productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure,
      etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or higher
      insurance premiums. This would result in a material negative impact on GDP
      globally by 2100 and hit governments' finances. Extreme weather events
      such as wildfires, floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent,
      impacting households, businesses, cities and states. There are also likely
      indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g.
      increased inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via
      biodiversity loss, or to industries' supply chains and international trade.

      The high physical risk scenario could lead to a significant reduction in
      GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on Indian sovereign bonds.

      As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects
      of climate change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in
      drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of
      human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political
      instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave
      affected areas, this may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even
      within a country, climate change could lead to higher inequality due to
      slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political
      instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between
      countries.

      **GDP growth effect**

      In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures could increase
      across the world by 2.4&deg;C to 3&deg;C compared to pre-industrial levels 
      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher 
      warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions 
      affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level 
      rise, which will consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. It can also 
      change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,
      wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.

      Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of
      increasing temperature on economic output, with productivity peaking at an
      annual average temperature of 13&deg;C and declining strongly at higher
      temperatures. In a high physical risk scenario, unmitigated warming is
      expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes
      by roughly 23% by 2100, relative to scenarios without climate change.

      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax
      revenues are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause
      further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain
      unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue.
      According to estimates from the NGFS, a hot house world scenario with high
      physical risk could result in significant GDP losses. In a hot house world
      scenario, world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects are 
      estimated to be between -5.7% and-6% (relative to a baseline with no transition 
      or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different
      temperatures projected for each scenario.  Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario
      Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a hot house world 
      scenario on India's GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would 
      be significant, ranging from -9.1% to -9.9% (relative to a baseline with no transition
      or physical risks) by 2050.
      
      Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience 
      investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of 
      economic sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms of products and 
      services).

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. No
      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces,

      significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by
      2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not
      necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries,
      but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA
      rating than a C rating. 
      
      According to the study, in a high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, India would have a downgrade 
      above five notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the Indian government 
      by approximately US$5.89-8.83bn.

      In a low physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth
      due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources,

      In a low physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures could increase
      across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels
      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing
      higher warming). These changes could lead
      to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour
      productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also
      further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
      heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.

      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax
      revenues are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause

      unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue.
      According to estimates from the NGFS, an Orderly transition with low

      world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated to
      be around -3% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) 
      by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different temperatures
