name: Health Underwriting Class
description: |
  The **Health** underwriting class covers personal, corporate and small to
  medium enterprise domestic health insurance predominantly in the UK market.
  Under the Solvency II definition of insurance lines of business these are
  reported under Medical Expense and Assistance.

  Heath underwriting risk refers to the potential deviation from the actuarial
  assumptions used for setting insurance premium rates which could lead to
  premium inadequacy. Heath underwriting risk should therefore consider both the
  setting of adequate premiums rates (pricing) and the management of claims
  (claims) for insurance policies.

      Health underwriting exposures could be impacted in the Disorderly/Divergent 
      transition risk scenarios, as a reduction in pollution could result for 
      example in a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, 
      heart attack and stroke. However, healthcare spending may reduce, and higher 
      claims costs could arise due to an increased carbon price on the supply chain.
    always: |
      Health underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition effects
      related to changes in pollution levels. In disorderly transition risk
      scenarios, the delayed transition driven by a late policy action enables a
      "fossil fuelled recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by
      COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 and a
      decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate for the
      inaction beforehand. The divergent scenario results in immediate but
      divergent reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This could lead to a
      significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, probably
      associated with a drive towards cleaner air (due to for example, an
      increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion
      engines). This would cause a reduction in pollution which could in turn
      result into a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases,
      heart attack and stroke. The disorderly transition risk scenario could
      also lead to a fall in GDP. This could result in changes in the rate of
      growth in healthcare spending.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing
      greenhouse gases could probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner
      air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important
      to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as
      CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) that lead to warming but do not
      directly impact health, with the production of pollutants (such as
      particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful
      to health. In the Delayed/Divergent scenarios, emissions of hazardous 
      pollutants, for example black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and oxides 
      of nitrogen, are projected to decrease. Emission trajectories for oxides 
      of nitrogen (NOx) can be seen here, but other hazardous pollutants in 
      the NGFS could equally be referenced as a guide as these have broadly 
      similar trajectories.

      Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with
      advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars are replaced with
      electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable
      sources), some climate outcomes may achieve one and not the other. For
      example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning this may reduce greenhouse effect but
        actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      - If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK)
        but without global buy-in then this could also reduce the correlation.

      In the Disorderly transition risk scenario, there is potential for fewer
      deaths and a positive outcome for health relating to air pollution. The
      reduction in pollution could result in a reduction of cancers (especially
      lung) and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections),
      but also cardiovascular disease, although we note that this is very much
      dependent on the fuel mix generating electrical power for the grid. For
      example, whilst waste-to energy plants have similar particulate outputs to
      gas-fired power stations, biomass plants such as wood pellet fired
      facilities, for their many positives, produce significantly more
      particulates than gas-fired power stations (Hajat et al., 2014).

      **GDP growth effect**

      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more
      on factors that can impact the nation's health and thus indirectly levels
      of claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and
      society chose to allocate any GDP growth.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenario could lead to a fall in GDP
      growth, A slower GDP growth would potentially constrain the growth in
      spending on NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. this
      would have negative impacts on health underwriting exposure and could
      result in challenges to the ongoing affordability of health insurance
      products, which, given their discretionary nature within the UK, may
      result in decreased market penetration. This could be particularly true of
      corporate health insurance cover, particularly for companies significantly
      impacted by transition risks, who may look to reduce costs. This may
      result in changes to product design and the nature of cover provided to
      try to mitigate these impacts.

      **Other effects**

      In addition, health care sector is a significant global carbon emitter,
      with large carbon footprints. This sector is likely to be affected by
      transition activities. This could potentially result in increased costs in
      the supply chain which ultimately could be passed onto insurers through
      increased claims costs. The Increased health care costs, due to increasing
      carbon prices, could equally place a strain on national health services as
      government spending is stretched. This may result in an increased demand
      for private health care cover.

      Health underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition effects
      related to changes in pollution levels. In Early/Orderly transition risk
      scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy
      strategies, and carbon legislation could lead to an immediate and smooth
      reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, and this would probably be
      associated with a drive towards cleaner air (due to for example, an
      increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion
      engines).

      This would cause a reduction in pollution which could in turn result into
      a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart
      attack and stroke. The Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios could also
      lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could result in
      changes in the rate of growth in healthcare spending. These are likely to
      have an impact on health insurance products' pricing, terms and conditions
      and coverage.

      In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in 
      increased disruption that could have an impact on the health underwriting 
      class, as morbidity could be affected by both a reduction in healthcare 
      spending as well as an increase in the myriad of health problems due to 
      higher temperatures.
    always: |
      In the high physical risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in
      an important disruption that could have a significant impact on health
      underwriting classes. Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average
      temperatures and rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute
      effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events
      (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could
      promote the development of diseases and the worsening of illnesses, and
      impact population health. Although all ages across the world could be
      impacted, some population groups could be more affected than others, such
      as children, elderly, and people with chronic diseases.

      This is could also result in increased claims for those health conditions
      affected. As health insurance products are generally annually renewable
      products these impacts can be factored into pricing as they emerge. This
      could also influence product design and the nature of conditions covered
      under health insurance contracts. Increased costs and frequency of medical
      conditions could place a strain on the national health service to the
      point that private health insurance may become a more attractive
      proposition for those looking to secure access to treatment.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
      over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact population health.
    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more
      on factors that can impact the nation's health and thus indirectly levels
      of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on
      how government and society chose to allocate any GDP growth. However,
      higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending
      on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is
      reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater "on
      average" if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how
      spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP
      would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas.

      Significant GDP growth reductions could lead to reductions in NHS funding
      which, assuming that funding is correlated to some extent with morbidity
      outcomes, would have negative impacts on health underwriting exposure.
      This could result in challenges to the ongoing affordability of health
      insurance products, which, given their discretionary nature within the UK,
      may result in decreased market penetration. This could be particularly
      true of corporate health insurance cover, particularly for companies
      significantly impacted by transition risks, who may look to reduce costs.
      This may result in changes to product design and the nature of cover
      provided to try to mitigate these impacts.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      In a high physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic effects such as
      temperature variation and weather events could pose significant challenges
      that could impact the health underwriting class. For example:

      - **Respiratory Disease and Allergies**: There is a direct link between
        the intensification of climate change and the worsening of existing
        respiratory diseases. Diseases that raise particular concern include
        asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease and respiratory tract infections.

      - **Cardiovascular disease**: Extreme and prolonged heat and air pollution
        could lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as
        ischemic heart disease, strokes, heart failure, arrhythmias and cardiac
        death; High temperatures could result in increased hospitalisations due
        to cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction.

      - **Mental Health**: Mental health consequences of climate change range
        from minimal stress and distress symptoms to clinical disorders, such as
        anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicide. It is estimated
        that, globally, as many as half of the people who survive extreme
        weather events experience adverse mental health outcomes. Anticipating
        mental health impacts and assessing vulnerable locations and populations
        is needed to prepare for the climate change impacts on mental health.

      - **Infectious disease**: Diseases traditionally associated with tropical
        and subtropical regions are reaching new areas of the world. Aedes-born
        virus, is anticipated to expand to North America and Europe as the
        continents become warmer, posing a threat to 49% of the world's
        population by 2050. It is expected that temperature-sensitive infectious
        diseases, could increase by around 20,000 additional cases per year by
        2030 in Europe. Permafrost thaw may also release unknown bacteria and
        viruses yet to be tackled by modern medicine.

      - **Dermatology**: Extreme weather events could result to an increase in
        skin infections, inflammatory skin diseases, and traumatic skin
        disorders.

      - **Elderly populations**: The elderly population are one of the most
        vulnerable groups to climate change. Both changes in heat and cold
        exposure elevate elderly risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
        deaths, as well as respiratory deaths and morbidity. As climate change
        is associated with an increase in extreme temperatures and weather
        events, adaptive strategies for those at highest risk and readiness from
        health providers is crucial.

      - **Pregnancy, New-born and Children**: Extreme heat adversely impacts
        birth outcomes (length of gestation, birth weight, and stillbirth
        increase). Studies also present links between various pollutants and the
        development of autism and asthma in children.

      - **Mortality**: Compared with a future without climate change, the World
        Health Organisation projected excess deaths for the year 2030: 38,000
        due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhoea, 60,000
        due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition.

      The above is likely to result in increased claims for those health
      conditions affected. These impacts are likely to manifest over a longer
      time frame however and could develop incrementally rather than as one-off
      events.

      There are several mitigating actions that could be taken against the
      potential risks, due to physical risks, to build resiliency against
      extreme weather events. For example, integrating climate change into the
      medical curriculum to better equip health professionals in the face of
      climate change driven emergencies and extreme weather events.
