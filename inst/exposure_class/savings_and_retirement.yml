  The **savings and retirement** underwriting class covers products such as
  pensions, investment bonds, with-profits, unit-linked investments and
  annuities, written on an individual or group basis.
  
  Customers may buy products to save towards financial goals, e.g. retirement 
  through regular contributions or ad hoc lump sums. These monies are then 
  invested by the provider on behalf of the policyholder, to create the 
  appropriate income stream or targeted pay-out as set out in the terms 
  and conditions.
  
  Providers writing savings and retirement business will be exposed to various 
  risks through these policies, including mortality, persistency, expense, 
  market and credit risks.

      Savings and retirement underwriting exposures could be impacted in 
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios, as the moderate to severe 
      reduction in GDP could reduce real household income. The reduction in 
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could also lead to an increase in longevity and reduction 
      in morbidity.
    always: |
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios, driven by late policy 
      action to enable a "fossil recovery" out of the COVID-19 economic crisis, 
      would result in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 before 
      rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon prices are increased to compensate 
      for the early inaction. In the Divergent Net Zero scenario CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions start to be reduced immediately but divergently, ultimately leading 
      to a significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. These reduced 
      emissions may be expected to correlate with a reduction in pollution and 
      therefore improved health outcomes, leading to a crystallisation of longevity 
      risk on annuity books.  On the other hand, for non-annuity savings and retirement 
      products a decrease in pollutants may lead to increased  profitability due to 
      reduced morbidity, i.e. as a result of increased policy terms higher rates of 
      saving and fewer lapses.
      
      These scenarios could result in a moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth 
      over the period of the transition, stabilising thereafter. This would lead to 
      reduced household incomes and could result in policyholder pessimism regarding 
      longer-term economic outcomes, leading to lower savings rates, increased lapses, 
      and a decrease in new business sales.

      **GDP growth effect**

      Under Disorderly transition risk scenarios, a moderate to severe 
      reduction in GDP growth is likely with associated repercussions on the levels 
      of health and social care spending. Slower GDP growth would potentially 
      constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, 
      private medical insurance etc. These scenarios are therefore correlated 
      with higher rates of both mortality and morbidity. However, the impact is 
      likely to be short-lived, or carry through within a small cohort of lives, 
      as the  GDP impact in these scenarios would be expected to stabilise after 
      the transition period. 
      
      The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes for the duration 
      of the transition, reducing savings rates and increasing lapse rates. 
      Providers are likely to be worse hit by these impacts where customers are 
      concentrated in sectors with greater exposure to transition risks (e.g. oil 
      and gas). 
      
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, transition costs are likely to be high and 
      concentrated in a short time. This may be expected to increase expenses. 
      The moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth would increase the risk of 
      guarantees biting on legacy policies. This would in turn impact the impacted 
      companies' bottom line and would likely result in more stringent capital 
      requirements as this risk emerges. Companies could face operational risk from 
      model error if past experience ceases to be a reliable predictor for future 
      trends.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
      could be associated with cleaner air and therefore positive health outcomes. 
      However, it is important to differentiate between the production of 
      greenhouse gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) that lead to 
      warming but do not directly impact health, and the production of pollutants 
      (such as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly 
      harmful to health. In the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, emissions of
      hazardous pollutants, for example black carbon, volatile organic compounds,
      and oxides of nitrogen, are projected to decrease. Emission trajectories for
      oxides of nitrogen (NOx) can be seen here, but other hazardous pollutants in 
      the NGFS could equally be referenced as a guide as these have broadly similar 
      trajectories.

      [IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios Database. REMIND-MAgPIE 3.0-4.4 model.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads){target="\_blank"}
      
      Whilst it may be the case that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are 
      typically correlated with reductions in harmful pollutants, this is not 
      necessarily the case. For example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning, this may reduce the greenhouse effect
        but actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      However, under Disorderly transition risk scenarios, there is 
      certainly potential for improved health outcomes due to reduced air 
      pollution and therefore fewer deaths. For example, reduced pollution 
      could result in a reduction of cancers (especially lung) and respiratory 
      diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections), and cardiovascular 
      disease. These outcomes are likely to have a material effect on annuity 
      providers. If annuity policyholders are living longer, annuity providers 
      are at risk of greater losses resulting from payments being made for 
      longer durations than anticipated when the annuities were originally 
      priced. The ultimate outcome is very much dependent on the fuel mix use 
      to generate electrical power for the national grid, as the suggested 
      improved health outcomes would rely on a net reduction in harmful 
      pollution.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the impact on pricing and product design 
      is likely to be modest. Though price adjustments may be necessary due to 
      expected impacts on mortality (as described above), as well as reduced market 
      sentiment and increased credit risk (due to impact on GDP growth 
      expectations). These price adjustments may negatively impact new business 
      sales, though this is likely to be relatively minor and will depend on the 
      price elasticity of providers' markets. 
      
      Even without price adjustments, the level of new business sales may be 
      impacted if customer optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. 
      That is, preferring to spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. 
      This risk would be greatest in the short to medium term under disorderly 
      scenarios.
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, 
      decreasing inflows for those organisations who do not have such products 
      in their range, and providing an opportunity for increased inflows for those 
      organisations that do.
      
      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if 
      considered to be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. 
      This could increase lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business 
      sales. Operational risk could also be impacted through a failure to attract 
      and retain talent.

      Savings and retirement underwriting exposures could be impacted in the 
      Orderly transition risk scenarios, as the limited reduction in GDP 
      could reduce real household income. The immediate and smooth reduction 
      in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could also lead to an increase in longevity and reduction 
      in morbidity.
    always: |
      The Orderly transition risk scenario could lead to a limited relative 
      reduction in GDP growth. However, any negative impacts on GDP are likely to 
      be smaller than in other scenarios. A reduction in GDP growth could result in 
      reduced real household income. In turn this may lead to lower savings rates 
      and increased lapses due to customers' affordability concerns. However, given 
      the impact on GDP is expected to be mild, and assuming customer sentiment on 
      longer-term economic outlook is unaffected, new business sales should not be 
      negatively impacted and the impact on saving rates and lapses should be limited.
      
      Under these scenarios, an immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions would be expected by 2050. This could lead to increased policyholder 
      longevity if pollutants also reduce over this period, resulting in annuities being 
      paid out for longer durations than currently expected, negatively impacting profit 
      margins for annuity providers. Similarly, customer morbidity may be reduced, leading 
      to savings and retirement products becoming more profitable from longer durations in 
      force and fewer lapses. Offsetting these impacts, on the other hand, would be the 
      expected reduction in household incomes, which could negatively impact health outcomes 
      and thus reduce policyholder longevity.

    high_materiality: |
      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, the impact on the savings and retirement underwriting
      class could depend on GDP as well as other effects. For example:
      
      **Diet effect**
      
      Under the Orderly transition risk scenarios consumers may seek to reduce their carbon footprint
      through changes in diet, for example away from carbon intensive processes such as livestock raising
      (e.g. through reduction in calorie intake or shift to plant-based diets). This 
      may result in lower levels of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and may also 
      improve mortality rates, but may also result in malnutrition which would have 
      a negative impact on health.

      **GDP growth effect**

      As a result of the expected mild impact on GDP, customers are likely to 
      experience correspondingly low impacts to incomes and maintain an optimistic 
      view of the future economy. Customers may therefore be expected to maintain 
      current levels of savings. Similarly, lapses, and the frequency of premium 
      reductions may be expected to be correspondingly low. 
      
      Transition costs are likely to be low and spread out over a moderate time period. 
      This may be expected to increase expenses, in particular from the regulatory 
      interventions necessary under an orderly scenario.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
      could be associated with cleaner air and therefore positive health outcomes. 
      However, it is important to differentiate between the production of greenhouse 
      gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) that lead to warming but do not 
      directly impact health, and the production of pollutants (such as particulate 
      matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful to health. In Orderly
      transition risk scenarios, emissions of hazardous pollutants, for example black carbon,
      volatile organic compounds, and oxides of nitrogen, are projected to decrease. Emission
      trajectories for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) can be seen here, but other hazardous pollutants 
      in the NGFS could equally be referenced as a guide as these have broadly similar trajectories.

      spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. The likelihood of this appears 
      low, however, under an orderly scenario.

      In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in 
      increased disruption that could have an impact on the Savings and Retirement 
      underwriting class, the significant reduction in GDP could impact household's 
      income. Mortality and morbidity could also be affected by both a reduction in 
      healthcare spending and an increase in the myriad of health problems due to 
      higher temperatures.
    always: |
      Under high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in 
      severe temperature increases and large increases in both the frequency and 
      severity of weather events that could have a significant impact on the saving 
      and retirement underwriting class. 
      
      Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average temperatures and rises 
      in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes 
      in the frequency and severity of weather events (such as floods, droughts, 
      bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could promote the development of 
      diseases and the worsening of illnesses. Vector-borne diseases may also 
      be expected to be more common and spread more quickly under this scenario. 
      These factors in combination would, be expected to negatively impact 
      population health and therefore increase providers' exposure to mortality 
      and morbidity risks, although this is dependent on location and may not 
      be as material in the UK as other locations. Mortality impacts are more 
      relevant to annuity providers, while morbidity impacts are more relevant 
      to providers of other savings and retirement products. 

      These factors may be expected to have severe negative impacts on GDP which 
      could exacerbate negative impacts on population health and lead to a fall 
      in savings rates, increased lapses and reduced new business sales.

    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      Under the high physical risk scenarios, significant reductions in GDP 
      growth are likely with associated repercussions on the levels of health 
      and social care spending. Slower GDP growth would potentially constrain 
      the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, private medical 
      insurance etc. These scenarios are therefore correlated with higher rates 
      of both mortality and morbidity. 
      
      The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes, reducing savings 
      rates and increasing lapse rates. Providers are likely to be worse hit 
      by these impacts where customers are concentrated in sectors with greater 
      exposure to physical risks.
      
      The moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth would increase the risk 
      of guarantees biting on legacy policies. This would in turn impact the 
      impacted companies' bottom line and would likely result in more stringent 
      capital requirements as this risk emerges.
      
      Companies could face operational risk from model error if past experience 
      ceases to be a reliable predictor for future trends.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      Under high physical risk scenarios, the increases in chronic climate 
      effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose 
      significant challenges that in turn could impact the saving and 
      retirement underwriting class. For example: 

      - **Mortality**: Due to the increased incidence in catastrophes, mortality
        rates for certain customer segments (depending on location) may also be
        expected to rise. A level increase in temperature in the UK could lead
        to a reduction in deaths since the reduction in excess deaths due to
        cold weather may outweigh any increase excess deaths due to warmer
        weather and the risk of prolonged heat waves. However, to the extent
        that any increase in temperatures comes with an increase in the
        variability of temperatures, we could see an increase in both winter and
        summer excess mortality.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is
        dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also
        differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings
        rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment
        periods for annuity providers.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under high physical risk scenarios, price adjustments may be necessary 
      due to expected impacts on mortality (as described above), as well as 
      reduced market sentiment and increased credit risk (due to impact on GDP 
      growth expectations). These price adjustments may negatively impact new 
      business sales, though this is likely to be relatively minor and will depend 
      on the combined price elasticity of providers' markets. Even without price 
      adjustments, the level of new business sales may be impacted if customer 
      optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. That is, preferring to 
      spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. Customers may prefer 
      to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, decreasing inflows for 
      those organisations who do not have such products in their range, and increasing 
      inflows for those organisations that do.
      
      Greater prevalence and severity of physical risk events may be expected to 
      negatively impact customer standards of living, depending on location. 
      Savings could therefore be expected to be accessed sooner, increasing lapse 
      rates and asset outflows within impacted regions. Inflows could also be 
      correspondingly lower as savings rates reduce, due to higher morbidity 
      affecting policyholders' capacity to earn and save income. Any increase in 
      lapse rates could drive up per policy expenses (as a fixed cost base is 
      spread out over fewer policies). Severe physical risk impacts to company 
      infrastructure (e.g. data centres and offices) could drive up unit costs. 
      The cost of ensuring resiliency, e.g. through redundancy, could also increase.
      
      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if 
      considered to be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. 
      This could increase lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business sales.

      In the low physical risk scenarios, climate change is expected to result

      rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to 
      changes in the frequency and severity of weather events (floods, droughts, 
      bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could impact population health by

      spending on NHS, public health, social care, private medical insurance etc. 
      These scenarios are therefore correlated with higher rates of both mortality 
      and morbidity. 
      
      The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes for the duration of 
      the transition, reducing savings rates and increasing lapse rates. Upward pressure 
      on expenses may be expected to due to the correlation with lapse rates and the 
      increased level of regulatory intervention necessary under these scenarios. 
      Providers are likely to be worse hit by these impacts where customers are 
      concentrated in sectors with greater exposure to transition risks (e.g. oil

      Even in a low physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate
      effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose
      significant challenges that in turn could impact the saving and retirement
      underwriting class. For example:

      - **Mortality**: Mortality rates may be expected to remain the same, or
        even improve as a result of climate change, depending on where the
        customers are located. For example, an increase in average UK temperatures 
        could lead to a reduction in excess deaths caused by cold weather and may 
        outweigh any increase in excess deaths caused by the risk of prolonged heat
        waves. However, to the extent that any increase in temperatures comes
        with an increase in the variability of temperatures, we could see an
        increase in both Winter and Summer excess mortality.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is
        dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also
        differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings
        rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment
        periods for annuity providers.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under these scenarios, the impact on pricing and product design is likely 
      to be modest. Though price adjustments may be necessary for certain locations 
      due to expected impacts on mortality (as described above), as well as reduced
      market sentiment and increased credit risk (due to impact on GDP growth expectations). 
      These price adjustments may negatively impact new business sales, though this is 
      likely to be relatively minor and will depend on the price elasticity of providers' 
      markets.
      
      Even without price adjustments, the level of new business sales may be 
      impacted if customer optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. That 
      is, preferring to spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. The 
      likelihood of this appears low, however, under low physical risk scenarios.
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, 
      decreasing inflows for those organisations who do not have such products in 
      their range, and increasing inflows for those organisations that do.

      Low physical risk scenarios would impact companies' infrastructure where 
      the infrastructure is located in areas affected by severe weather events. 
      This would put upward pressure on expenses and may lead to both operational 
      and resulting reputational risks (e.g. extreme weather events impacting 
      providers' ability to process new and existing business). 
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products,

      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if 
      considered to be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. 
      This could increase lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business 
      sales.
