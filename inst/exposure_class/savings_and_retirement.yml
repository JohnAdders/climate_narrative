  The **Savings and Retirement** underwriting class covers products such as
  pensions, investment bonds, with-profits, unit-linked investments and
  annuities, written on an individual or group basis.
  
  Customers may buy products to save towards financial goals, e.g. retirement 
  through regular contributions or ad hoc lump sums. These monies are then 
  invested by the provider on behalf of the policyholder, to create the 
  appropriate income stream or targeted pay-out as set out in the terms 
  and conditions.
  
  Providers writing savings and retirement business will be exposed to various 
  risks through these policies, including mortality, persistency, expense, 
  market and credit risks.

    always: |
      Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, driven by late policy 
      action to enable a "fossil recovery" out of the COVID-19 economic crisis, 
      would result in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 before 
      rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon prices are increased to compensate 
      for the early inaction. In the Divergent Net Zero scenario CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions start to be reduced immediately but divergently, ultimately leading 
      to a significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. These reduced 
      emissions may be expected to correlate with a reduction in pollution and 
      therefore improved health outcomes, leading to a crystallisation of longevity 
      risk on annuity books.  On the other hand, for non-annuity savings and retirement 
      products a decrease in pollutants may lead to increased  profitability due to 
      reduced morbidity, i.e. as a result of increased policy terms higher rates of 
      saving and fewer lapses.
      
      These scenarios could result in a moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth 
      over the period of the transition, stabilising thereafter. This would lead to 
      reduced household incomes and could result in policyholder pessimism regarding 
      longer-term economic outcomes, leading to lower savings rates, increased lapses, 
      and a decrease in new business sales. 

    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      Under Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios, a moderate to severe 
      reduction in GDP growth is likely with  associated repercussions on the levels 
      of health and social care spending. Slower GDP growth would potentially 
      constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, 
      private medical insurance etc. These scenarios are therefore correlated 
      with higher rates of both mortality and morbidity. However, the impact is 
      likely to be short-lived, or carry through within a small cohort of lives, 
      as the  GDP impact in these scenarios would be expected to stabilise after 
      the transition period. 
      
      The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes for the duration 
      of the transition, reducing savings rates and increasing lapse rates. 
      Providers are likely to be worse hit by these impacts where customers are 
      concentrated in sectors with greater exposure to transition risks (e.g. oil 
      and gas). 
      
      In a Disorderly transition, transition costs are likely to be high and 
      concentrated in a short time. This may be expected to increase expenses. 
      The moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth would increase the risk of 
      guarantees biting on legacy policies. This would in turn impact the impacted 
      companies' bottom line and would likely result in more stringent capital 
      requirements as this risk emerges. Companies could face operational risk from 
      model error if past experience ceases to be a reliable predictor for future 
      trends.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
      could be associated with cleaner air and therefore positive health outcomes. 
      However, it is important to differentiate between the production of 
      greenhouse gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) that lead to 
      warming but do not directly impact health, and the production of pollutants 
      (such as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly 
      harmful to health.
      
      Whilst it may be the case that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are 
      typically correlated with reductions in harmful pollutants, this is not 
      necessarily the case. For example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning, this may reduce the greenhouse effect
        but actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      However, under Delayed/Divergent transition risk scenarios, there is 
      certainly potential for improved health outcomes due to reduced air 
      pollution and therefore fewer deaths. For example, reduced pollution 
      could result in a reduction of cancers (especially lung) and respiratory 
      diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections), and cardiovascular 
      disease. These outcomes are likely to have a material effect on annuity 
      providers. If annuity policyholders are living longer, annuity providers 
      are at risk of greater losses resulting from payments being made for 
      longer durations than anticipated when the annuities were originally 
      priced. The ultimate outcome is very much dependent on the fuel mix use 
      to generate electrical power for the national grid, as the suggested 
      improved health outcomes would rely on a net reduction in harmful 
      pollution.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under a disorderly transition, the impact on pricing and product design 
      is likely to be modest. Though price adjustments may be necessary due to 
      expected impacts on mortality (as described above), as well as reduced market 
      sentiment and increased credit risk (due to impact on GDP growth 
      expectations). These price adjustments may negatively impact new business 
      sales, though this is likely to be relatively minor and will depend on the 
      price elasticity of providers' markets. 
      
      Even without price adjustments, the level of new business sales may be 
      impacted if customer optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. 
      That is, preferring to spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. 
      This risk would be greatest in the short to medium term under disorderly 
      scenarios.
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, 
      decreasing inflows for those organisations who do not have such products 
      in their range, and increasing inflows for those organisations that do.
      
      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if 
      considered to be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. 
      This could increase lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business 
      sales. Operational risk could also be impacted through a failure to attract 
      and retain talent.

  low:
    always: |
      The Early/Orderly transition risk scenario could lead to a limited relative 
      reduction in GDP growth. However, any negative impacts on GDP are likely to 
      be smaller than in other scenarios. A reduction in GDP growth could result in 
      reduced real household income. In turn this may lead to lower savings rates 
      and increased lapses due to customers' affordability concerns. However, given 
      the impact on GDP is expected to be mild, and assuming customer sentiment on 
      longer-term economic outlook is unaffected, new business sales should not be 
      negatively impacted and the impact on saving rates and lapses should be limited.
      
      Under the Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios, an immediate and smooth 
      reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would be expected by 2050. This could 
      lead to increased policyholder longevity if pollutants also reduce over this 
      period, resulting in annuities being paid out for longer durations than currently 
      expected, negatively impacting profit margins for annuity providers. Similarly, 
      customer morbidity may be reduced, leading to savings and retirement products becoming 
      more profitable from longer durations in force and fewer lapses. Offsetting these 
      impacts, on the other hand, would be the expected reduction in household incomes, 
      which could negatively impact health outcomes and thus reduce policyholder longevity.

    high_materiality: |
      Under the Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios, changes in diet (e.g. 
      reduction in calorie intake or shift to plant-based diets) may result in 
      lower levels of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and may also 
      improve mortality rates, but may also result in malnutrition which would have 
      a negative impact on health.

      **GDP growth effect**

      As a result of the expected mild impact on GDP, customers are likely to 
      experience correspondingly low impacts to incomes and maintain an optimistic 
      view of the future economy. Customers may therefore be expected to maintain 
      current levels of savings. Similarly, lapses, and the frequency of premium 
      reductions may be expected to be correspondingly low. 
      
      Transition costs are likely to be low and spread out over a moderate time period. 
      This may be expected to increase expenses, in particular from the regulatory 
      interventions necessary under an orderly scenario.

      **Pollution effect**

      It seems reasonable to assume that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
      could be associated with cleaner air and therefore positive health outcomes. 
      However, it is important to differentiate between the production of greenhouse 
      gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) that lead to warming but do not 
      directly impact health, and the production of pollutants (such as particulate 
      matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful to health. 

      Whilst it may be the case that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are 
      typically correlated with reductions in harmful pollutants, this is not necessarily 
      the case. For example:

      - If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on
        fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the
        particulates but not the greenhouse effect.

      - If we increase biomass burning this may reduce the greenhouse effect but
        actually contribute to local particulate pollution.

      However, under Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios, there is certainly 
      potential for improved health outcomes due to reduced air pollution and therefore 
      fewer deaths. For example, reduced pollution could result in a reduction of 
      cancers (especially lung) and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory 
      allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract 
      infections), and cardiovascular disease. These outcomes are likely to have a 
      material effect on annuity providers. If annuity policyholders are living longer, 
      annuity providers are at risk of greater losses resulting from payments being 
      made for longer durations than anticipated when the annuities were originally 
      priced. The ultimate outcome is very much dependent on the fuel mix use to 
      generate electrical power for the national grid, as the suggested improved health 
      outcomes would rely on a net reduction in harmful pollution.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under an orderly transition, the impact on pricing and product design is likely 
      to be modest. Though price adjustments may be necessary due to expected impacts 
      on mortality (as described above), as well as reduced market sentiment and increased 
      credit risk (due to impact on GDP growth expectations). These price adjustments may 
      negatively impact new business sales, though this is likely to be relatively minor 
      and will depend on the price elasticity of providers' markets.
      
      Even without price adjustments, the level of new business sales may be impacted if 
      customer optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. That is, preferring to 
      spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. The likelihood of this appears 
      low, however, under an orderly scenario.
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, decreasing 
      inflows for those organisations who do not have such products in their range and 
      increasing inflows for those organisations that do.
      
      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if considered to 
      be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. This could increase 
      lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business sales.

physical:
  high:
    always: |
      Under high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in 
      severe temperature increases and large increases in both the frequency and 
      severity of weather events that could have significant impact on the saving 
      and retirement underwriting class. 
      
      Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average temperatures and rises 
      in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes 
      in the frequency and severity of weather events (such as floods, droughts, 
      bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could promote the development of 
      diseases and the worsening of illnesses. Vector-borne diseases may also 
      be expected to be more common and spread more quickly under this scenario. 
      These factors in combination would, be expected to negatively impact 
      population health and therefore increase providers' exposure to mortality 
      and morbidity risks, although this is dependent on location and may not 
      be as material in the UK as other locations. Mortality impacts are more 
      relevant to annuity providers, while morbidity impacts are more relevant 
      to providers of other savings and retirement products. 

      These factors may be expected to have severe negative impacts on GDP which 
      could exacerbate negative impacts on population health and lead to a fall 
      in savings rates, increased lapses and reduced new business sales.

    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      Under the high physical risk scenarios, significant reductions in GDP 
      growth are likely with associated repercussions on the levels of health 
      and social care spending. Slower GDP growth would potentially constrain 
      the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, private medical 
      insurance etc. These scenarios are therefore correlated with higher rates 
      of both mortality and morbidity. 
      
      The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes, reducing savings 
      rates and increasing lapse rates. Providers are likely to be worse hit 
      by these impacts where customers are concentrated in sectors with greater 
      exposure to physical risks.
      
      The moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth would increase the risk 
      of guarantees biting on legacy policies. This would in turn impact the 
      impacted companies' bottom line and would likely result in more stringent 
      capital requirements as this risk emerges.
      
      Companies could face operational risk from model error if past experience 
      ceases to be a reliable predictor for future trends.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      Under high physical risk scenarios, the increases in chronic climate 
      effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose 
      significant challenges that in turn could impact the saving and 
      retirement underwriting class. For example: 

      - **Mortality**: Due to the increased incidence in catastrophes, mortality
        rates for certain customer segments (depending on location) may also be
        expected to rise. A level increase in temperature in the UK could lead
        to a reduction in deaths since the reduction in excess deaths due to
        cold weather may outweigh any increase excess deaths due to warmer
        weather and the risk of prolonged heat waves. However, to the extent
        that any increase in temperatures comes with an increase in the
        variability of temperatures, we could see an increase in both winter and
        summer excess mortality.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is
        dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also
        differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings
        rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment
        periods for annuity providers.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under high physical risk scenarios, price adjustments may be necessary 
      due to expected impacts on mortality (as described above), as well as 
      reduced market sentiment and increased credit risk (due to impact on GDP 
      growth expectations). These price adjustments may negatively impact new 
      business sales, though this is likely to be relatively minor and will depend 
      on the combined price elasticity of providers' markets. Even without price 
      adjustments, the level of new business sales may be impacted if customer 
      optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. That is, preferring to 
      spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. Customers may prefer 
      to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, decreasing inflows for 
      those organisations who do not have such products in their range, and increasing 
      inflows for those organisations that do.
      
      Greater prevalence and severity of physical risk events may be expected to 
      negatively impact customer standards of living, depending on location. 
      Savings could therefore be expected to be accessed sooner, increasing lapse 
      rates and asset outflows within impacted regions. Inflows could also be 
      correspondingly lower as savings rates reduce, due to higher morbidity 
      affecting policyholders' capacity to earn and save income. Any increase in 
      lapse rates could drive up per policy expenses (as a fixed cost base is 
      spread out over fewer policies). Severe physical risk impacts to company 
      infrastructure (e.g. data centres and offices) could drive up unit costs. 
      The cost of ensuring resiliency, e.g. through redundancy, could also increase.
      
      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if 
      considered to be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. 
      This could increase lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business sales.

  low:
    always: |
      In the low physical risk scenarios, climate change is expected to result 
      in material disruption  to the savings and retirement underwriting class. 
      Chronic effects (such as higher average global temperatures and potential 
      rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to 
      changes in the frequency and severity of weather events (floods, droughts, 
      bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could impact population health by 
      promoting the development of diseases and the worsening of illnesses. Mortality 
      and morbidity may be expected to increase as a result, although this is 
      dependent on location and may not be as material in the UK as other locations. 
      Mortality impacts are more relevant to annuity providers, while morbidity 
      impacts are more relevant to providers of other savings and retirement products. 
      
      The low physical risk scenarios could lead to reduced GDP growth. A reduction 
      in GDP growth could result in reduced real household income. In turn this may 
      lead to lower savings rates and increased lapses due to customers' affordability 
      concerns, resulting in reduced profitability within savings and retirement products. 

    high_materiality: |
      **GDP growth effect**

      Under the low physical risk scenarios, a significant reduction in GDP growth 
      is likely with associated repercussions on the levels of health and social 
      care spending. Slower GDP growth would potentially constrain the growth in 
      spending on NHS, public health, social care, private medical insurance etc. 
      These scenarios are therefore correlated with higher rates of both mortality 
      and morbidity. 
      
      The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes for the duration of 
      the transition, reducing savings rates and increasing lapse rates. Upward pressure 
      on expenses may be expected to due to the correlation with lapse rates and the 
      increased level of regulatory intervention necessary under these scenarios. 
      Providers are likely to be worse hit by these impacts where customers are 
      concentrated in sectors with greater exposure to transition risks (e.g. oil 
      and gas).
      
      The moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth would increase the risk of 
      guarantees biting on legacy policies. This would in turn impact the impacted 
      companies' bottom line and would likely result in more stringent capital 
      requirements as this risk emerges.

      **Temperature and weather effect**

      Even in a low physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate
      effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose
      significant challenges that in turn could impact the saving and retirement
      underwriting class. For example:

      - **Mortality**: Mortality rates may be expected to remain the same, or
        even improve as a result climate change, depending on where the
        customers are located. For example, an increase in average UK temperatures 
        could lead to a reduction in excess deaths caused by cold weather and may 
        outweigh any increase in excess deaths caused by the risk of prolonged heat
        waves. However, to the extent that any increase in temperatures comes
        with an increase in the variability of temperatures, we could see an
        increase in both Winter and Summer excess mortality.

      - **Morbidity**: A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the
        incidence rates of skin cancer. The prevalence of skin cancer is
        dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also
        differ by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high
        temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular
        risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to lower savings
        rates and increased lapses for savings products and shorter payment
        periods for annuity providers.

      **Impact on pricing or product design**

      Under these scenarios, the impact on pricing and product design is likely 
      to be modest. Though price adjustments may be necessary for certain locations 
      due to expected impacts on mortality (as described above), as well as reduced
      market sentiment and increased credit risk (due to impact on GDP growth expectations). 
      These price adjustments may negatively impact new business sales, though this is 
      likely to be relatively minor and will depend on the price elasticity of providers' 
      markets.
      
      Even without price adjustments, the level of new business sales may be 
      impacted if customer optimism is low regarding future economic outlook. That 
      is, preferring to spend today rather than save for an uncertain future. The 
      likelihood of this appears low, however, under low physical risk scenarios.
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, 
      decreasing inflows for those organisations who do not have such products in 
      their range, and increasing inflows for those organisations that do.

      Low physical risk scenarios would impact companies' infrastructure where 
      the infrastructure is located in areas affected by severe weather events. 
      This would put upward pressure on expenses and may lead to both operational 
      and resulting reputational risks (e.g. extreme weather events impacting 
      providers' ability to process new and existing business). 
      
      Customers may prefer to buy or switch to sustainable investment products, 
      decreasing inflows for those organisations who do not have such products in 
      their range, and increasing inflows for those organisations that do.
      
      As with all climate scenarios, companies will face reputational risk if 
      considered to be laggards in their reporting and reaction to climate change. 
      This could increase lapse rates, reduce premiums and reduce new business 
      sales.
