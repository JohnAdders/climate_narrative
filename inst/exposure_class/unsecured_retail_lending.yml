  Unsecured retail lending refers to finance provided to individuals 
  where the amount borrowed is based upon the affordability of the applicant(s), on 
  a capital repayment basis, and covers three broad product types:
  
  - Credit Cards
  
  - Unsecured Personal Loans (UPL)
  
  - Personal Current Accounts in the form of Overdrafts (PCA)

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, unsecured retail lenders are likely to 
      be impacted by a potential decline in affordability as customers' cost of living increases 
      due to, for example, rising energy costs and retrofitting costs.
    always: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, where the economy could experience a sharp 
      shock, typical drivers of unsecured losses, for example unemployment, are likely 
      to worsen, generating significant losses for unsecured retail lending.
      
      These scenarios could also result in changing patterns in energy generation, which may increase 
      energy costs, as well as changes to minimum Efficiency Performance Certificate (EPC) standards, 
      which could create retrofitting costs for property owners, affecting customers' ability to 
      repay balances. This could impact affordability and generate losses for unsecured retail lending. 
      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a moderate to severe reduction in GDP 
      growth that could result in a significant increase of unsecured losses.

      The following examples show how the Unsecured retail lending exposure could be impacted 
      in a Disorderly transition risk scenario:
      
      - Rising energy costs are likely to put a significant strain on affordability, 
        which poses a risk to customers' ability to repay balances. Customers may resort to 
        increasing utilisation on their Credit Cards and PCA which increases indebtedness on 
        the book and, over time, will likely result in an increase in defaults. 
        
        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, electricity price increases in the short term, 
        peaking around 2035 in the Delayed transition scenario and 2030 in the Divergent Net Zero 
        scenario,and remains above 2020 levels at 2050. Oil and gas prices increase throughout, both doubling
        by 2050 in the Delayed transition scenario. Gas prices reach an almost four-fold increase by 2035 
        in the Divergent Net Zero scenario.

      - Retrofitting costs could also put a strain on affordability and generate significant 
        losses (if not mitigated by government subsidy) as consumers are required to spend 
        significant sums to upgrade their properties to minimum EPC standards. Currently proposed 
        legislation would require all residential property to have an EPC C rating by 2035, 
        with ~70% of properties needing retrofits to achieve this. Clearly this presents an 
        opportunity to firms that are able to support the unsecured financing of retrofitting 
        products, but from a risk perspective this is likely to have a short-term shock effect, 
        particularly for highly indebted customers that would not ordinarily meet minimum lending 
        criteria to receive further credit.
      - Macro-economic effects. The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a moderate 
        to severe reduction in GDP growth which could result in a significant increase of unsecured losses 
        (due to, for example, increased unemployment). However, this may be somewhat mitigated by the bank 
        base rate outlook in these scenarios which can ease the strain on affordability.
      
      Since many of these risk factors are shared across unsecured and secured lending, where 
      possible, it is prudent to look at the interaction effects between the portfolios. 
      For example, it may be possible to identify pockets of mortgage customers that are 
      susceptible to certain types of climate-related transition risk (e.g. older properties 
      with high retrofitting costs) and infer that this could adversely affect unsecured lending 
      exposures the bank has to the customer. However, it should be considered that not all unsecured 
      customers will also have mortgages.
      
      Interconnectedness with other relevant client segments, products and risk types could also be considered 
      for a holistic assessment of potential losses arising from manifestation of climate risks. For example, 
      if climate risks manifest materially in the unsecured portfolios, sources of retail liquidity might be 
      challenged as well.

      In High physical risk scenarios, unsecured retail lenders are likely to be impacted 
      through macro-economic effects typically associated with unsecured losses, as well 
      as changes to affordability as customers' cost of living increases.
    always: |
      Chronic effects (e.g. rising sea-levels) and acute effects due to changes in the 
      frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
      cyclones and flooding are projected to have macro-economic impacts, with an adverse 
      effect on world GDP assumed in these scenarios, which could result in losses for 
      unsecured lending. Physical risks may also impact affordability as customers' 
      cost of living increases (due to, for example, increased insurance costs), and indirectly 
      results in further losses for unsecured lending. 

    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the Unsecured retail lending exposure could be 
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
      
      - Macro-economic effects. The slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes and may be 
        associated with typical drivers of unsecured losses (for example unemployment). Banks are 
        likely to be worse hit by these impacts where customers are concentrated in areas with greater 
        exposure to physical risks. However, this may be somewhat mitigated by the bank base rate outlook 
        in these scenarios which can ease the strain on affordability.
      
      - Widespread increases to insurance premiums are likely, which could affect customers' 
        ability to repay balances as a result of more income being spent on insurance, potentially 
        increasing probabilities of default, although this will vary significantly based on 
        geographical and external factors such as FloodRe. Also, as some properties become 
        uninsurable, or as customers elect not to prioritise premiums, the risk of one-off 
        events occurring that would severely impact on customers' abilities to service outstanding 
        debt will increase.
      
      Since many of these risk factors are shared across unsecured and secured lending, where 
      possible, it is prudent to look at the interaction effects between the portfolios. For 
      example, it may be possible to identify pockets of mortgage customers that are susceptible 
      to certain types of physical risks (e.g. those in high flood risk areas) and infer that this could 
      adversely affect unsecured lending exposures the bank has to the customer. However, it should be 
      considered that not all unsecured customers will also have mortgages.

      The unsecured retail lending exposure could be impacted in a low physical risk scenario. For 
      example, by widespread increases to insurance premiums, which could affect customers' ability 
      to repay balances as a result of more income being spent on insurance, potentially increasing 
      probabilities of default, although this will vary significantly based on geographical and external 
      factors such as FloodRe. Also, as some properties become uninsurable, or as customers elect not to 
      prioritise premiums, the risk of one-off events occurring that would severely impact on customers' 
      abilities to service outstanding debt will increase.

  As discussed throughout this section, it can be challenging to produce granular results 
  in terms of climate risk quantification for the Unsecured lending asset class.  As a result, 
  a suitable modelling approach could be to focus on high level climate-adjusted input variables 
  in the core modelling (e.g. macroeconomic variables) overlaid with additional risk 
  considerations such as cost of retrofitting and higher utilisation due to rising energy 
  prices. 
  
  As well as considering each of these factors in isolation, a comprehensive review of climate risk 
  on the Unsecured portfolio should measure interactions between factors which could exacerbate losses. 
  Particular attention should be paid to pockets of concentration risk (e.g. customers within geographical 
  regions subject to severe flood risks or types of business) which may not be visible under a high-level 
  approach which doesn't model behaviour at an account level.  It may also be useful to compare correlations 
  between susceptibility to climate risks and traditional risk factors measured through PD scores or bureau 
  information which would increase risk of losses. On a forward-looking basis, interconnectedness with 
  potential losses from other segments, products or risk types could also be considered to manage climate 
  risks holistically (e.g. if climate risks manifest materially in the unsecured portfolios, sources of retail 
  liquidity might be challenged).
  
  The following examples identify some general challenges around modelling Climate Risk for 
  unsecured portfolios:
  
  - Relatively high default rates on these products (compared to Mortgages for example) means 
    that extrapolating annual PDs over a long time horizon results in a high proportion of 
    the book in default at the end of scenario, especially in a static balance sheet exercise 
    where defaulting is an absorbing state. This raises an interesting challenge around the 
    concept of 'survivorship bias' and how to accurately estimate default rates several decades 
    into the future. The natural rate of defaulting, which occurs irrespective of the prevailing 
    economic conditions, may outweigh the signal from climate specific impacts in any given 
    scenario.
  
  - Account-level modelling over a significant time horizon on high volume portfolios 
    (e.g. PCA, Consumer Cards) can pose a challenge in terms of required processing power 
    which may require simplifications to the modelling approach.

  - As discussed, an accurate view of interaction effects between Secured and Unsecured risk 
    factors requires a single customer view which may require linking together data across 
    various platforms, products and models, which may present operational challenges.
  
  - Modelling losses on a closed book over a significant time horizon for products that have 
    relatively short product life (e.g. UPL) can create difficulties in interpreting results, 
    particularly as it is not possible to account for proactive or reactive changes in lending 
    strategy that would occur as economic circumstances change. 

  - Even in cases where account level data is available, it is not always possible to discern 
    how funds from new lending are being spent. This makes it difficult to assess whether there 
    are any additional first-order climate impacts that should be accounted for.
