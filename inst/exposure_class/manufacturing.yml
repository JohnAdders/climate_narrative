  The **manufacturing** sector involves the transformation of (mainly) raw
  materials or substances into new products by way of mechanical, physical, or
  chemical processes. Manufactured products derived from the assembly of
  component parts also comprise the manufacturing sector - unless otherwise
  specified. Manufacturing establishments are typically referred to as mills,
  factories or plants and tend to use power-driven machinery or handling
  equipment in the manufacturing process, however it is not unusual for some
  manufacturing activities to occur in a domestic setting.

  Although the boundaries between the manufacturing sector and others are not
  always obvious (hence, the inclusion of miscellaneous manufacturing as a
  sub-sector). The North American Industrial Code (NAIC) system breaks down 
  the manufacturing sector into the following sub-sectors:
  
  - Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing
  
  - Paint, Coating, and Adhesive Manufacturing
  
  - Soap, Cleaning Compound, and Toilet Preparation Manufacturing
  
  - Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing
  
  - Plastics Product Manufacturing
  
  - Rubber Product Manufacturing
  
  - Glass and Glass Product Manufacturing
  
  - Clay Product and Refractory Manufacturing
  
  - Cement and Concrete Product Manufacturing
  
  - Lime and Gypsum Product Manufacturing
  
  - Other Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing
  
  - Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing
  
  - Steel Product Manufacturing from Purchased Steel
  
  - Alumina and Aluminum Production and Processing
  
  - Nonferrous Metal (except Aluminum) Production and Processing
  
  - Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing

  - Food manufacturing

  - Beverage and tobacco product manufacturing

  - Textile manufacturing (including textile product mills, apparel
    manufacturing and leather and allied product manufacturing)

  - Wood product manufacturing (including paper manufacturing and printing and
    related support activities)

  - Petroleum and coal products manufacturing
  
  - Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing (including Medical Equipment and Supplies Manufacturing)

  - Chemical manufacturing (including plastics and rubber products
    manufacturing)

  - Non-metallic mineral product manufacturing

  - Primary metal manufacturing (including fabricated metal product
    manufacturing and machinery manufacturing)

  - Computer and electronic product manufacturing (including electrical
    equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing)

  - Transportation equipment manufacturing (including Motor, Railroad Rolling Stock, Aerospace Product, Ship and Boat manufacturing)

  - Furniture and related product manufacturing.

  - Miscellaneous manufacturing.
  
  - Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing
  
  - Technology, electric and electronics manufacturing (including Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, 
    Household Appliance, Commercial Refrigeration, Computer and Peripheral Equipment, Communications Equipment, 
    Audio and Video Equipment, etc)

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, manufacturers could 
      benefit from new revenue streams, but face rising operating costs due 
      to carbon pricing policies and falling asset values as current infrastructure 
      becomes increasingly obsolete. 
    always: |
      Whilst a sizeable proportion of manufacturing activity continues to
      reinforce economic dependence on fossil fuels, some areas of manufacturing
      are increasingly supporting the transition to a low carbon economy. This
      is heavily influenced by various characteristics such as
      the political will within a given jurisdiction, the availability of
      climate finance or whether there is an economic rationale to consider
      abatement. An example of this includes the integration of sustainable
      materials in apparel manufacturing to appeal to the climate conscious
      consumer.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the manufacturing sector could be impacted in a
      Disorderly transition risk scenario:

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon intensive exports (see
        EU's proposed Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism) and rising
        energy costs.

      - **Reduced revenue** due to decline in demand for consumer discretionary
        manufacturing products as abatement costs are likely passed onto the
        consumer.

      - **Falling asset values resulting in stranded assets** in
        carbon-intensive manufacturing industries as the impairment of the
        economic value of company assets such as existing infrastructure
        required for transport equipment manufacturing.

      - **Increased revenue** for industries that can support the global
        transition to Net Zero such as carbon capture storage (CCS)
        manufacturing. 
        
      - In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, CCS utilisation is projected 
        to increase dramatically, with between ~5500 and ~6500 megatons of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        being stored annually by 2050.

      - **Increased demand for skilled labour** to support the research,
        development, and implementation of climate mitigation strategies.

      - **Readjusted capital expenditures** new investments required to pivot
        business models towards low-carbon manufacturing processes and the
        integration of renewable energy sources in largescale manufacturing
        establishments.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the manufacturing
      sector could achieve long-term carbon neutrality through new manufacturing
      processes supported by clean energy sources, a circular economy which
      increases materials efficiency and widespread carbon capture storage (CCS)
      utilisation.

      In these scenarios, the manufacturing sector is forced to significantly increase 
      production of key commodities to support the global transition whilst simultaneously 
      reducing its carbon footprint. This is likely to result in:

      - A sharp disruption to production (with asset damage).

      - Operating challenges with significant increases in costs.

      - Volatile commodity markets and a real uncertainty in demand.

      - High risk of stranded assets.

      Manufacturing industries that adopt a Disorderly pathway to net zero
      emissions under Disorderly transition risk scenarios may
      significantly **lose market value**. It is expected that those industries
      could face stranded assets as uncertainty about climate policies and
      unanticipated breakthroughs in renewable technologies collide with
      substantial intertemporal and intersectoral investment adjustment costs.
      Carbon-intensive manufacturing activities such as petroleum and coal
      products manufacturing, chemical manufacturing and primary metal
      manufacturing are at particularly high risk. The result is stranded assets
      and legal claims. 
      
      Due to the breadth and complexity of the manufacturing
      sector, manufacturing industries could need to adopt a range of different
      strategies based on specific circumstances of each industry and company in
      order to reduce the impact of this scenario. Some of these strategies include:
      
      - Mitigating the environmental impact of utilising high carbon footprint metals 
        in potentially carbon-neutral manufacturing equipment and motors.
        
      - Integrating energy efficiency capital and processes into existing manufacturing 
        processes in a way that considers whole-life carbon (to avoid capital-expensive rebuilds). 
        
      - Revising business models to consider global supply chain emissions, particularly from 
        raw material extraction and transportation.
        
      - Reduce demand for high-temperature processes.
      
      - Support the transition of large technical systems through long-term investment cycles.

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, carbon pricing mechanisms will 
      gradually increase which will force polluters in the manufacturing sector 
      towards efforts to achieve long-term carbon neutrality, such as 
      clean energy sources, a circular economy which increases
      materials efficiency and widespread carbon capture storage (CCS)
      utilisation. A strong policy environment that supports manufacturers'
      decarbonisation efforts could result in an immediate and smooth reduction
      of emissions. For example, in Orderly transition risk scenarios,
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are expected to reduce between 76% and 94% by
      2050 from 2020 levels based on CCS utilisation, fuel-switching, and
      improvements to resource and energy efficiency.

      Due to the breadth and complexity of the manufacturing sector,
      manufacturing industries could need to adopt a range of different
      strategies based on specific circumstances of each industry and company in

      - Support the transition of large technical systems through long-term investment cycles.
      
      Additionally, critics suggest the effectiveness of carbon pricing schemes 
      in facilitating abatement in the manufacturing sector is highly dependent 
      upon whether the price of carbon adequately causes polluters to address the 
      negative externalities they generate.

      The manufacturing sector is highly exposed to high physical risk 
      scenarios due to the projected increase in weather variation and 
      the disruption this could cause to global supply chains. 
    always: |
      At present, some manufacturing activities remain vulnerable to the
      physical impacts of climate change due to their reliance on raw materials
      and dependence on global supply chains, such that disruptions in one
      region can quickly result in world-wide shortages (In 2011, excessive
      flooding in Thailand resulted in a reduction in global industrial output
      by 2.5 percent and damages cost the world's top three non-life insurance
      companies $5.3 billion in claims, which is greater than the cost of
      Japan's earthquake and tsunami earlier the same year). For example, food
      manufactures, who rely on rice and wheat crops, already experience a
      reduction in the availability of raw materials as empirical analyses
      demonstrate a link between an annual decrease of 0.3-0.9% in rice and
      wheat yields as a result of climate-related weather effects.

      Without adequate adaptation strategies, continued exposure to changing
      weather conditions could significantly affect specific areas of
      manufacturing, affecting the profitability of these companies.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the manufacturing sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Acute Impacts**

      - Extreme **Wildfire** events may result in significant material losses
        for some manufacturing activities due to raw material scarcity and
        damage to facilities and equipment.

      - **Flooding events** could cause significant damage to facilities and
        equipment.

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - Some industries can expect significant reductions in labour productivity
        as global mean temperatures rise.

      - **Drought** could result in competition amongst manufacturers water
        resources which could affect production levels as industry accounts for
        approximately 40% of total water abstractions. It could also likely lead
        to an expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on
        protecting water supply and quality. This would incur hefty additional
        costs for water using industries.

      - The **expansion of tropical pests and diseases** into temperate zones
        could, again, influence the regional availability of raw materials and
        increase the volatility of global commodity markets. For example, it is
        thought a lack of genetic variation amongst rubber trees means rubber
        production is highly susceptible to diseases which could significantly
        availability of rubber on a global scale.
        
      - **Rising sea levels** could pose risks to the
        manufacturing sector through substantial damage to facilities and
        equipment leading to establishment closures. This may result in
        abandoned assets and long-term disruptions to manufacturing outputs as
        companies struggle to move their operations.

      There are many actions manufacturing companies can take to adapt to high
      physical risks mentioned above. This includes investing in more resilient
      physical infrastructure, significantly diversifying supplier portfolios,
      increasing the geographical competence of manufacturing operations and
      creating robust technical systems that can identify future physical
      stresses (particularly in the case of food manufacturing). By embedding
      such measures into long term climate business planning, manufacturing
      companies are better placed to absorb physical shocks in a high physical
      risk scenario.

      For example, where the availability of raw materials is declining,
      companies can look to integrate other materials into their manufacturing
      processes to reduce the supply-side risks associated with one material. In
      fact, manufacturing companies in a high physical risk scenario would adopt
      one or more of the following supply-chain characteristics to maintain
      resilience against the physical risks:

      - **Dependence**, a company could assess its dependence on a given
        supplier and seek to increase suppliers where possible and/or invest
        heavily critical suppliers to exercise more control over key decisions.

      - **Visibility**, a company could seek to fully understand the
        vulnerabilities, location, and operations and of its first and second
        tier suppliers and adopt strategies to reduce their risk accordingly
        such as increasing inventory stocks to mitigate acute stresses.

      - **Substitutability**, a company could assess the feasibility of
        replacing standard parts in its manufacturing process.

      - **Portability**, a company could make efforts to assess the ease at
        which physical machinery and other manufacturing operations can be moved
        when faced with disaster.
