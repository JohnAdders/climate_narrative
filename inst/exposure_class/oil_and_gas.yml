name: Oil and gas sector
test_report_position: 1
description: |
  The **oil and gas sector** comprises three main activities - upstream
  (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and processing) and
  downstream (distribution and sale to end users/consumers). This sector
  includes companies that are, for example, involved in the following:

  - the exploration/extraction, development and/or the production of natural gas from wells
    in which the hydrocarbons could initially flow or can be produced using
    normal or enhanced drilling and extraction techniques

  - the production of crude petroleum from reservoirs in which the hydrocarbons
    are semisolids

  - the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from oil and gas field gases.

  - manufacturing machinery and equipment for the use in the oil and gas sector
    or for drilling water wells, including portable drilling rigs.

  - producing gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils and residual fuel oils
    through refraction or straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation,
    cracking or other processes.

  - transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas for sale

  - operating oil and gas wells as well as those engaged in providing support
    services.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, demand for oil and gas decreases, 
      which could affect profitability of individual companies and the sector overall. 
    always: |
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios, REMIND model, by 2050, in a
      Disorderly transition risk scenario, fossil fuels represent only
      ~25% to ~35% of global energy demand compared to ~85% in 2020. Carbon-intensive
      sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable
      to the transition. In a delayed transition scenario, the policy delays
      lead to a "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought
      about by COVID-19, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030,
      before decreasing sharply afterwards to compensate for the inaction to
      that date. In the Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but
      divergent reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across sectors.

      While oil and gas could continue to play a role in meeting global energy
      demand in the short- and medium-term, the changing patterns in energy
      consumption, driven by societal change, national energy strategies, and
      carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and long-term impact
      on demand for oil and gas, affecting profitability in both scenarios.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a
      reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of
      growth in demand for the oil and gas sector.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy prices can
      result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Reduced revenue** due to decline in fossil fuel demand as consumers
        switch to low-carbon/electrified alternatives for cars, heating etc;
        this could impact business models, including service providers who
        derive revenue from the oil and gas industry. (Note that there may be a
        double effect on revenues since companies may be able to pass on some of
        the increased carbon costs to consumers in the form of higher prices).

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions via tax or
        cap & trade clearing programs

      - **Readjusted capital expenditures** focusing on new investments required
        to pivot business model towards low-carbon fuels, renewable biofuels
        and/or Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS)

      - **Rapidly falling asset values** of oil and gas reserves and
        infrastructure required for extraction, based on re-adjusted
        expectations of much lower demand for fossil fuels in future

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the oil and gas sector
      is likely to be significantly impacted. Driven by increased
      electrification, total electricity capacity and generation jumps markedly,
      and the underlying sources change dramatically. Solar is the dominant
      technology representing over half of electricity generation capacity by
      2050, completely displacing coal and gas (both before 2025).

      Demand for oil and gas decreases rapidly as the share of renewables in the
      electricity generation mix increases.

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) rise above 
      2020 levels along with secondary energy prices (i.e. paid by large scale consumers) 
      , with the increased operating costs from paying a price on carbon emissions partially 
      passed to downstream consumers

      Under Disorderly transition risk scenarios, belated awareness by
      financial market participants of the scale and speed of the transition
      required may cause fossil fuel assets to undergo a fire-sale by investors,
      at the moment when they fully understand the real risk involved in holding
      these in their portfolios.

      Because the oil and gas sector is so diverse, there is no single solution,
      but rather a range of strategies based on the circumstances of each
      company that could need to be deployed in these scenarios to maintain 
      revenues and minimise the long-term financial impact. Examples include 
      transitioning to become an integrated energy company providing renewable power 
      generation or investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, demand for oil and gas decreases, 
      which could affect profitability of individual companies and the sector overall. 
    always: |
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios, REMIND model, by 2050, in
      Orderly transition risk scenarios, fossil fuels represent only ~25% to ~40%
      of global energy demand compared to ~85% in 2020. Carbon-intensive sectors
      such as oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to
      transition.

      While oil and gas could continue to play a role in meeting global energy
      demand in the short- to medium-term, the changing patterns in energy
      consumption, driven by societal change, national energy strategies, and
      carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and long-term impact
      on demand for oil and gas, affecting profitability of individual companies
      and the sector overall.

      These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP 
      growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand 
      for the oil and gas sector.

      The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy prices could
      potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Reduced revenue** due to decline in fossil fuel demand as consumers
        switch to low-carbon/electrified alternatives for cars, heating etc;
        this could potentially impact business models, including service

      - **Falling asset values** of oil and gas reserves and infrastructure
        required for extraction based on re-adjusted expectations of much lower
        demand of fossil fuels in the future

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, capital investment into fossil fuel
      extraction and supply could be significantly lower than investment into renewable
      electricity and storage. There is still some legacy capital investment in fossil fuel 
      extraction to maintain the infrastructure while phasing down the overall capacity.

      Overall, demand for oil and gas decreases steadily as the share of
      renewables in the electricity generation mix increases. The share of electric vehicles on the roads
      could also steadily increase and a large share of the remaining
      conventional vehicles could use biofuels instead of petrol or diesel, further contributing to a decrease 
      in demand for the oil and gas sector. In Orderly transition risk scenarios, consumption of oil and gas 
      combined falls from ~300 exajoules per year to between ~120 and ~200 exajoules per year by 2050.

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) rise
      above 2020 levels along with secondary energy prices (i.e. paid by large scale

      Based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios, REMIND model, by 2050,
      renewables and biomass would cover ~70% of global primary energy needs
      (compared to ~15% in 2020), driving stranding of fossil fuel assets.

      Oil and gas is one of the sectors that are highly exposed to physical risk 
      scenarios due to the increase in weather variation. These scenarios could also 
      lead to a significant GDP impact which could negatively affect demand for this 
      sector.
    always: |
      The oil and gas sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of
      climate change including both the chronic effects (e.g. rising sea-levels)
      and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather
      events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and
      flooding. Whilst the oil and gas industry is used to responding to and
      managing changing weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario,
      climate change and global warming could increase weather variations. This
      could lead to increasing disruption to oil and gas production which could
      impact the profitability for these companies.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these vary in line with different temperatures projected for
      each scenario. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively affect demand for oil and
      gas.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the oil and gas sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Rising sea levels** could cause frequent disruption to coastal oil
        refineries and potentially could cause closures especially when
        compounded with storm surge events, such as those generated by
        cyclones. For example, hurricane Katrina caused the total shutdown of
        oil production in the Gulf of Mexico for 6 months (for further detail see
        [IIGCC oil and gas document](https://iigcc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Oil-and-Gas.pdf){target="\_blank"}).

      - **Water stress/long-term drought** could lead to greater competition
        between oil and gas companies as they fight for scarce water resources.
        It could also likely lead to an expectation of increased environmental
        regulation focusing on protecting water supply and quality. This would
        incur hefty additional costs for water intensive industries.

      - **Thawing permafrost** could lead to widespread regions of pipeline
        subsidence, causing damage and increased maintenance costs. New pipeline
        construction costs could also increase due to building on unstable
        ground.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Cyclones** are likely to have a significant effect on
        construction, offshore production, onshore processing and decommission
        phases of oil and gas projects resulting from major disruptions as well
        as significant damage to facilities. Extreme conditions from major
        storms would lead to large spills/leaks resulting in significant
        clean-up costs. Increased frequency of cyclones could also lead
        to successive events leading to delays in return to business as usual.

      - **Floods** could pose serious risks to the oil and gas sector such as
        significant damage to facilities and refineries, loss of production, and
        increasing risks of dispersal of salt and chemicals from coal seam gas
        mines onto farming land.

      - **Wildfires**, as methane is highly flammable, gas vented from leaks in
        compressors or pipelines can be ignited by sparks or embers from
        bushfires leading to devastating wildfires.

      Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for oil and
      gas through a decrease in spending power of economic agents.

      There are many mitigating actions companies can take against the physical
      risks mentioned above. For example, investing in more resilient offshore
      rigs, improved drainage systems and better equipment to be able to
      withstand stronger cyclones, a more robust design of infrastructure and
      stricter construction standards. To reduce the impact of rising sea
      levels, the position of new facilities should consider climate change to
      minimise the risk of total damage caused by flooding.

      Whilst the oil and gas industry is used to responding to and managing

      - **Water stress/long-term drought** could lead to competition between oil
        and gas companies for water resources. There is a chance that it could
        lead to increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting water
        supply and quality which would add costs for water- intensive
        industries.

      - **Thawing permafrost** could lead to areas of pipeline subsidence,
        causing damage and associated increased maintenance costs.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Cyclones** could have an effect on the construction, offshore
        production, onshore processing and decommission phases of oil and gas
        projects resulting from either short-term disruption or damage to
        facilities. These conditions could also lead to spills/leaks resulting
        in additional clean-up costs.

      - **Floods** could pose risks to the oil and gas sector such as damage to
        facilities, refineries, loss of production and increasing risks of
        dispersal of salt and chemicals from coal seam gas mines onto farming
