  The **financial services** sector covers a broad range of business that
  provide a variety of economic services, such as investing, managing and
  lending money, insurance and capital and debt markets. Central banking, also
  part of this sector, is outside the scope of this tool. More formally, the
  Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector covers business that:

  - lend funds, which might be raised from depositors, credit market borrowing
    or by borrowing from other financial intermediaries. This covers firms like
    banks and building societies.

  - facilitate the lending of funds or issuance of credit by engaging in such
    activities as mortgage and loan brokerage, clearinghouse and reserve
    services, and check cashing services.

  Firms in the Securities, Commodity Contracts, and Other Financial Investments
  subsector are primarily engaged in one of the following:

  - underwriting securities issues and/or making markets for securities and
    commodities

  - acting as agents (i.e., brokers) between buyers and sellers of securities
    and commodities

  - providing securities and commodity exchange services; and

  - providing other services, such as managing portfolios of assets; providing
    investment advice; and trust, fiduciary, and custody services.

  Insurance companies underwrite annuities and provide insurance policies.
  Industries in the Funds, Trusts, and Other Financial Vehicles subsector are
  comprised of legal entities that pool securities or other assets on behalf of
  shareholders or beneficiaries of employee benefit or other trust funds.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the change to carbon and 
      energy prices, regulations, consumer behaviour etc. could impact financial 
      firms. However, the extent will depend on their business model, regions 
      in which they operate as well as the industries/sectors that they provide 
      financial services to (e.g. those providing services to fossil fuel industries 
      are potentially more exposed).
    always: |
      Financial firms are at the heart of our economy, they serve as a 
      facilitator and intermediary for encouraging, mobilising and allocating 
      funds towards their most productive use and play a critical role in 
      mitigating risk.
      
      Because they have relatively low greenhouse gas emissions, 
      the main climate-related transition risks for most financial firms are from their 
      counterparties (that is, firms they lend to, invest in and/or insure 
      such as corporates and households) and/or the assets they manage. Therefore, to determine 
      the nature of the transition risks for financial firms, it is necessary to examine the 
      industries/sectors of their underlying exposures. 

      In Disorderly scenarios, we expect to see a change in regulation, laws, consumer 
      behaviour and/or technological development. These changes could affect real financial 
      asset valuations significantly, with considerable regional differences. Sectors that are most 
      vulnerable to these changes tend to be in the carbon intensive sectors or have limited 
      ability to pass price increases to customers. Hence, concentrations of lending 
      or underwriting to these sectors could be more highly exposed.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in policy, carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy 
      prices could impact financial firms. For example:
      
      * Tightening energy efficiency standards for domestic and commercial 
      buildings could impact the risk in banks' buy-to-let lending portfolios. 
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, emissions from residential and commercial 
      buildings are projected to fall due to increased efficiency from tightened 
      standards (as well as a change in energy mix).

      * **Rapid technological change**, such as the development of electric vehicles 
      or renewable energy technology, affecting the value of financial assets in the 
      automotive and energy sector. 
      
      * **Higher losses or claims related to counterparties** that fail to mitigate 
      or adapt to climate change.

      Material exposures for financial firms in Disorderly transition
      risk scenarios could tend to occur where there are concentrations of
      lending, insurance underwriting, asset management and/or trading to

      (i) industries or companies that are carbon intensive (e.g. Transport,
      Buildings Materials, Industrials),

      (ii) industries where it is hard to pass cost increases onto customers,
      and

      (iii) companies that have a narrow range of products that could be phased
      out (e.g. a manufacturing company whose sole customer base is thermal coal
      mines).

      Financial firms investing in climate solutions, for example, renewable
      energy, green hydrogen, battery electric vehicles, and carbon capture and
      storage (technologies and market set to grow in Disorderly transition
      scenarios) or investing in companies with ambitious commitments to reduce
      their carbon emissions across the value chain in line with the Paris
      Agreement should be less exposed to transition risk than financial firms
      investing in companies with carbon intensive activities with little or no
      ambition to change (current and future carbon emissions misaligned with
      the Paris Agreement). Financial firms' exposure to transition risks also
      depends on their geographical and business mix (including jurisdictions
      most exposed to carbon policy risks and technologies which are the most
      threatened by the transition, for example, Internal Combustion Engines in
      the Automobile sector).

      Financial firms could need to identity whether their portfolio has exposures to
      these types of industries and engage with these counterparties to aid
      their transition to a low carbon economy or, where this is not possible
      (e.g. when the portfolio must be adjusted quickly), divest. Failure to do
      this could result in further transition risks, such as a reduced social
      licence to operate as their firm suffers reputational damage. 
      
      To mitigate this reputational risk, financial firms would also need to 
      communicate progress in this area through disclosing their financed emissions. 
      Although it has been estimated that the finance sector funds emissions in an 
      amount that is more than 700 times greater than its own emissions, currently 
      only one quarter of financial firms disclose their financed emissions (
      for further detail see: [From the Grand to the Granular: Translating Just Transition Ambitions into Investor Action)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/From-the-Grand-to-the-Granular_translating-just-transition-ambitions-into-investor-action.pdf).
      
      Asset managers must also consider reputational transition risks and 
      avoid 'leakage' by ensuring their repriced carbon intensive assets are 
      retired or modified, rather than sold on and used elsewhere.

      Financial firms wield great power through their business activities and 
      the decisions they make on what to finance, to insure and under which conditions, 
      and which products and companies to invest in. In addition, they can be instrumental 
      in the way they engage with and lobby policymakers. They can engage with the 
      political process, individually or collectively, and can even influence the 
      'rules of the game'. Therefore, they  need to identify whether their 
      portfolios have exposures to these types of industries and engage with these
      counterparties to aid their transition to a low carbon economy or, where
      this is not possible (e.g. when the portfolio must be adjusted quickly),

    exec_description: |
      For most financial firms, the main physical risks are from their 
      counterparties (i.e. firms they lend to, invest in and/or insure such 
      as corporates and households) and/or the assets they manage.
    always: |
      Financial firms are at the heart of our economy, they serve as a 
      facilitator and intermediary for encouraging, mobilising and allocating 
      funds towards their most productive use and play a critical role in 
      mitigating risk.
      
      Financial firms could need to consider how to adapt their physical operations 
      to ensure the safety of their staff and more general business continuity concerns. 
      However, because their own inherent operations only require a relatively small amount 
      of tangible (physical) capital, the main climate-related physical risks for most financial 
      firms are from their counterparties (that is, firms they lend to invest in and/or insure 
      such as corporates and households) and/or the assets they manage. Therefore, to determine 
      the nature of physical risks for financial firms, it is necessary to examine the 
      industries/sectors of their underlying exposures.
      
      A high physical risk scenario could be associated with chronic changes in living conditions 
      affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also 
      change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, 
      and flooding. These changes could negatively affect counterparties and impact real financial asset 
      valuations, with considerable regional differences. 
    high_materiality: |
      Financial firms are highly exposed to physical risks, particularly 
      those with concentrations of lending, insurance underwriting, asset 
      management and/or trading in geographies that could be affected by any 
      of the different climate changes. Financial firms with physical operations, 
      such as offices, data centres, branch networks, could also be exposed to physical 
      risks within their own operations.
      
      The following examples illustrate how financial firms
      could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Cyclones or storms** are likely to have a significant effect on many
        different types of industries.

      - **Coastal and river flooding**. Rising sea levels and changes in
        precipitation patterns could pose flooding risks to many sectors.
      
      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Drought** could lead to greater competition between companies as they
        fight for scarce water resources. It could also likely lead to an
        expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting
        water supply and quality. This would incur hefty additional costs for
        water using industries.

      - **Temperature** increases in some regions could be substantial,
        affecting everything from agriculture, to transport, to medical care.

      There could be direct impacts on counterparties as well as residential and 
      commercial real estate, potentially reducing the value of those properties 
      that are held as collateral against loans, thereby increasing loss given 
      default if the customer is not able to repay the loan. Increasing frequency, 
      severity or volatility of extreme weather events could also increase claims for 
      non-life insurance companies', meaning that premiums could need to be increased 
      to maintain margins. The insurance market already devotes much resource to acute 
      impacts e.g. flood modelling and flood mapping, as a key weather peril. Different 
      insurance entities could have different areas of focus, depending on the size, 
      risk profile, business mix etc.

      In high physical risk scenarios, it may be that certain risks become
      uninsurable. That could have knock on consequences for other companies in
      the financial system. Counterparties' supply chains may also be vulnerable
      to physical impacts, affecting their sales, profit and loss, and balance
      sheets. 
      
      Financial firms could need to identity whether their portfolio has exposures 
      to these physical risks. To determine the nature of physical risks requires 
      information on the geographic location of assets. Assessing the risks to these 
      assets requires insights on the vulnerability (for example, how reliant is the 
      asset on climate sensitive supplies?), the likelihood of a 'damage event' (e.g. flooding 
      or heat-related failures), and the exposure (i.e. the amount invested in that location).
