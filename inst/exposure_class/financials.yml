  The **Financial Services** sector covers a broad range of business that
  provide a variety of economic services, such as investing, managing and
  lending money, insurance and capital and debt markets. Central banking, also
  part of this sector, is outside the scope of this tool. More formally, the
  Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector covers business that

  - lend funds, which might be raised from depositors, credit market borrowing
    or by borrowing from other financial intermediaries. This covers firms like
    banks and building societies.

  - facilitate the lending of funds or issuance of credit by engaging in such
    activities as mortgage and loan brokerage, clearinghouse and reserve
    services, and check cashing services.

  Firms in the Securities, Commodity Contracts, and Other Financial Investments
  subsector are primarily engaged in one of the following:

  - underwriting securities issues and/or making markets for securities and
    commodities

  - acting as agents (i.e., brokers) between buyers and sellers of securities
    and commodities

  - providing securities and commodity exchange services; and

  - providing other services, such as managing portfolios of assets; providing
    investment advice; and trust, fiduciary, and custody services.

  Insurance companies underwrite annuities and provide insurance policies.
  Industries in the Funds, Trusts, and Other Financial Vehicles subsector are
  comprised of legal entities that pool securities or other assets on behalf of
  shareholders or beneficiaries of employee benefit or other trust funds.

      Financial services are at the heart of our economy, they serve as a 
      facilitator and intermediary for encouraging, mobilising and allocating 
      funds towards their most productive use and play a critical role in 
      mitigating risk. The risks from climate change could largely depend 
      on the business model of the financial service and the regions in which 
      it operates. Because they have relatively low greenhouse gas emissions, 
      the main financial risk for most financial institutions is from the impact 
      of transition (and physical) risks on their counterparties (that is, firms 
      they lend to, invest in and/or insure such as corporates and households) 
      and/or the assets they manage.

      Where the increases in carbon and energy prices in the Disorderly transition
      risk scenario could potentially result in financial impacts; the extent
      of these will depend on the industries/sectors of financial services' underlying
      exposures. The Disorderly transition risk scenario can affect real
      financial asset valuations significantly, with considerable regional
      differences. Sectors with high emissions are arguably most exposed to
      transition risk. To determine the nature of the transition risks for financial 
      services, it is necessary to examine the industries/sectors of their underlying 
      exposures. 

      In a disorderly transition risk scenario, we expect to see a sharp change
      in regulation, laws, consumer behaviour and/or technological development.
      Sectors that are most vulnerable to this change tend to be in
      the carbon intensive sectors or have limited ability to pass price
      increases to customers. Hence, concentrations of lending or underwriting
      to these sectors could be more highly exposed.

      As highlighted in [SS3/19]https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/supervisory-statement/2019/ss319), the changes in policy, carbon pricing, energy 
      demand/mix and energy prices could impact financial services. For example:
      
      The changes in policy, carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy 
      prices could potentially result in one or more of the following 
      impacts for financial firms:
      
      * Tightening energy efficiency standards for domestic and commercial 
      buildings could impact the risk in banks' buy-to-let lending portfolios. 
      In Early/Orderly scenarios, emissions from residential and commercial 
      buildings are projected to fall due to increased efficiency from tightened 
      standards (as well as a change in energy mix).

      [IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios Database.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads){target="\_blank"}
      
      * **Falling asset values** due to rapid technological change, such as the 
      development of electric vehicles or renewable energy technology, affecting 
      the value of financial assets in the automotive and energy sector. 
      
      * **Higher claims/loss of market value of counterparties** as companies in 
      the wider economy that fail to mitigate, adapt to, or disclose the financial 
      risks from climate change could be exposed to climate-related litigation, 
      which could impact their market value or lead to higher claims for insurers 
      that provide liability cover to those companies.

      Material exposures for financial institutions in Disorderly transition
      risk scenarios could tend to occur where there are concentrations of
      lending, insurance underwriting, asset management and/or trading to

      (i) industries or companies that are carbon intensive (e.g. Transport,
      Buildings Materials, Industrials),

      (ii) industries where it is hard to pass cost increases onto customers,
      and

      (iii) companies that have a narrow range of products that could be phased
      out (e.g. a manufacturing company whose sole customer base is thermal coal
      mines).

      Financial services investing in climate solutions, for example, renewable
      energy, green hydrogen, battery electric vehicles, and carbon capture and
      storage (technologies and market set to grow in a Disorderly transition
      scenario) or investing in companies with ambitious commitments to reduce
      their carbon emissions across the value chain in line with the Paris
      Agreement should be less exposed to transition risk than financial services
      investing in companies with carbon intensive activities with little or no
      ambition to change (current and future carbon emissions misaligned with
      the Paris Agreement). Financial services' exposure to transition risks also
      depends on their geographical and business mix (including jurisdictions
      most exposed to carbon policy risks and technologies which are the most
      threatened by the transition, for example, Internal Combustion Engines in
      the Automobile sector).

      Financial services could need to identity whether their portfolio has exposures to
      these types of industries and engage with these counterparties to aid
      their transition to a low carbon economy or, where this is not possible
      (e.g. when the portfolio must be adjusted quickly), divest. Failure to do
      this could result in further transition risks, such as a reduced social
      licence to operate as their service suffers reputational damage. 
      
      To mitigate this reputational risk, financial services would also need to 
      communicate progress in this area through disclosing their financed emissions. 
      Although it has been estimated that the finance sector funds emissions in an 
      amount that is more than 700 times greater than its own emissions, currently 
      only one quarter of financial institutions disclose their financed emissions (

      Asset managers must also consider reputational transition risks and 
      avoid 'leakage' by ensuring their repriced carbon intensive assets are 
      retired or modified, rather than sold on and used elsewhere.

      Financial services wield great power through their business activities and 
      the decisions they make on what to finance, to insure and under which conditions, 
      and which products and companies to invest in. In addition, they can be instrumental 
      in the way they engage with and lobby policymakers. They can engage with the 
      political process, individually or collectively, and can even influence the 
      'rules of the game'. Therefore, they  need to identity whether their 
      portfolios have exposures to these types of industries and engage with these
      counterparties to aid their transition to a low carbon economy or, where
      this is not possible (e.g. when the portfolio must be adjusted quickly),

      corporates and households) and/or the assets they manage.

      To determine the nature of physical risks requires information on the
      geographic location of assets. Assessing the risks to these assets
      requires insights on the vulnerability (for example, how reliant is the
      asset on climate sensitive supplies?), the likelihood of a 'damage event'
      (e.g. flooding or heat-related failures), and the exposure (i.e. the
      amount invested in that location). A high physical risk scenario could be
      associated with chronic changes in living conditions affecting health,
      labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can
      also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
      heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. Financial
      services could need to consider how to adapt their physical operations to
      ensure the safety of their staff and more general business continuity
      concerns. But their main financial risk could arise from the impact on
      their counterparties, which could be largely a function of their
      geographic location.
    high_materiality: |
      Financial services are highly exposed to physical risks, particularly 
      those with concentrations of lending, insurance underwriting, asset 
      management and/or trading in geographies that could be affected by any 
      of the different climate changes. Financial services with physical operations, 
      such as offices, data centres, branch networks, could also be exposed to physical 
      risks within their own operations.
      
      The following examples illustrate how financial institutions
      could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Cyclones or storms** are likely to have a significant effect on many
        different types of industries.

      - **Coastal and river flooding**. Rising sea levels and changes in
        precipitation patterns could pose flooding risks to many sectors.
      
      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Drought** could lead to greater competition between companies as they
        fight for scarce water resources. It could also likely lead to an
        expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting
        water supply and quality. This would incur hefty additional costs for
        water using industries.

      - **Temperature** increases in some regions could be substantial,
        affecting everything from agriculture, to transport, to medical care.

      There could be direct impacts on counterparties, impacting residential and 
      commercial real estate, potentially reducing the value of those properties 
      that are held as collateral against loans. This can lead to increased credit 
      risks, particularly for banks, or to underwriting risks for liability insurers 
      if it results in legal claims to recover financial losses from this physical 
      damage. 
      
      Increasing frequency, severity or volatility of extreme weather events could 
      also increase losses for non-life insurance companies', meaning that premiums 
      could need to be increased to maintain margins. The insurance market already 
      devotes much resource to acute impacts e.g. flood modelling and flood 
      mapping, as a key weather peril. Different insurance entities could have 
      different areas of focus, depending on the size, risk profile, business mix etc.

      In high physical risk scenarios, it may be that certain risks become
      uninsurable. That could have knock on consequences for other companies in
      the financial system. Counterparties' supply chains may also be vulnerable
      to physical impacts, affecting their sales, profit and loss, and balance
      sheets. Financial services could need to identity whether their portfolio 
      has exposures to these types of climate impacts, and also assess 
      the extent to which there are local defences, which reduce the risk.
