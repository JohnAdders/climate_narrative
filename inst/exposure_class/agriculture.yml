name: Agriculture Sector
test_report_position: 2
description: |
  The **agriculture** sector can be split into crop production and animal
  production.

  Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and
  fibre. This subsector comprises establishments such as farms, orchards,
  groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops,
  plants, vines, or trees and their seeds. The industries in this subsector are
  grouped by similarity of production activity, the length of growing season,
  degree of crop rotation, extent of input specialization, labour requirements
  and capital demands.

  The production process is typically completed when the raw product or
  commodity grown reaches the "farm gate" for market, that is, at the point of
  first sale or price determination. Within the subsector, the NAICS classifies
  establishments to a specific industry when a product or industry family of
  products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit
  and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the establishment's
  agricultural production.

  Industries in the Animal Production, Fishing and Aquaculture subsector raise or fatten
  animals for the sale of animals or animal products and/or raise aquatic plants
  and animals in controlled or selected aquatic environments for the sale of
  aquatic plants, animals, or their products. The subsector includes
  establishments, such as ranches, farms, and feedlots primarily engaged in
  keeping, grazing, breeding, or feeding animals. These animals are kept for the
  products they produce or for eventual sale. The industries in this subsector
  are grouped by important factors, such as suitable grazing or pastureland,
  specialized buildings, type of equipment and the amount and types of labour
  required.

  Establishments are classified to the Animal Production, Fishing and Aquaculture
  subsector when animal production (i.e., value of animals for market) accounts
  for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the agriculture sector can 
      benefit from expanding markets but faces greater risks of stranded assets, 
      geographic growth constraints, and rising production costs in the face of 
      new emissions costs, land use restrictions, and necessary productivity 
      improvements.
    always: |
      The agriculture sector continues to expand to feed and supply agricultural
      energy products to a growing global population. It contributes to 23% of
      anthropogenic emissions, exposing its producers and financiers to emerging
      climate related transition risks through public policies, consumer demand
      shifts and technological evolutions.

      In the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action
      enables a "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought
      about by COVID-19. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030, before
      sharply decreasing after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand.
      In the Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent
      reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. These scenarios are likely to have
      a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Agricultural value chains face
      material climate transition risk exposure due to their emissions intensity
      and reliance on land. Under these scenarios, the expansion 
      of land protection policies and carbon payments made to preserve and expand 
      forests could reduce land available for agriculture.

      These scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could result 
      in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the agriculture sector, although 
      the impact is likely to be limited due to inelastic demand for food products.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in food and bioenergy demand, emission pricing or taxes,
      consumer preferences and land use restrictions could potentially result in
      one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Revenue growth** due to rising global demand and commodity prices.

      - **Rising production costs** due to higher input costs and GHG emissions
        costs

      - **Increase in capital expenditures** as farms need to invest in research
        and development and deployment of new technologies necessary for
        long-term productivity growth

      - **More write-offs of assets** as expansion of land protection policies
        to preserve and expand forests could reduce land available for
        agriculture.

      The agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but faces greater
      risks of stranded assets, geographic growth constraints, and rising
      production costs in the face of new emissions costs, land use
      restrictions, and necessary productivity improvements.

      The sector has very high GHG emissions as farm and livestock productions
      and activities are emission intensive. In Disorderly transition risk scenarios,
      although the agriculture sector's GHG emissions are projected to fall, it is to 
      a lesser extent than other sectors, making agriculture, forestry and other land use 
      (AFOLU) the largest GHG emitting sector by 2050.

      The total demand could continue to increase in the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, 
      however growth in demand for food production is limited.

      As the use of bioenergy increases, by 2050, approx. 35% of total
      agricultural production in the Divergent Net Zero scenario, and 
      around 30% in the Delayed transition scenario, is consumed for energy generation.

      The agriculture sector is key driver of forest loss, and due to forest
      conservation and preservation policies, availability of agricultural land
      reduces, limiting the growth of agricultural land cover. However,
      technological innovations in yields and productivity increase land use
      efficiency, allowing agriculture production to continue to increase with
      the rising demand of food and energy due to population growth. By 2050,
      agricultural land could increase by around 80 million hectares in the Delayed
      transition scenario and decrease by 25 million hectares in the Divergent Net Zero
      scenario. Forest cover could increase by around 210 to 390 million hectares.

      The operational and production costs of firms could increase as they need
      to make necessary investments for technological upgrades and increase in
      carbon taxes. But producers should be able to pass the higher input costs
      to consumers due to inelastic demand of food and increasing usage of clean
      bioenergy and biofuels.

      Despite these material risks, agricultural companies and investors can
      also derive significant opportunities from climate transitions. By
      investing in sustainable intensification, regenerative agriculture, and
      diversifying revenue streams, forward-looking agricultural companies could
      see their net value and profitability rise under transitions.

      The agriculture sector is highly exposed to high physical risk scenarios 
      due to the projected increase in weather variation. These scenarios could 
      also lead to a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand 
      for this sector.
    always: |
      The agriculture sector is also exposed to physical risk. Chronic effects
      (e.g. raised sea-levels and mean temperatures) and acute effects due to
      changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves,
      wildfires, cyclones, and flooding are adding to pressures on
      global agricultural and food systems and could lead to severe disruption
      to agricultural production which could impact the profitability for some
      companies in long-run. Whilst the agriculture sector is used to responding
      to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high physical risk
      scenario, climate change and global warming could increase weather
      variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to the agriculture sector
      which could impact profitability.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these vary in line with different temperatures projected for each 
      scenario. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively affect demand for
      agriculture, although the impact is likely to be limited due to inelastic
      demand for food products.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the agriculture sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Increase in sea-level rise**, may lead to substantial losses in crop
        and livestock production in low-lying agricultural areas and may
        contribute to waterlogging and soil erosion. Wetter weather could
        threaten agricultural production by adversely affecting crop yields.

      - **Higher average temperatures** could have an impact on production, this
        could vary across the regions. Warmer, drier climates in tropical
        regions may have a negative impact on production whereas production in
        colder and wetter areas may benefit from warm conditions.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Changing rainfall patterns** and reduced availability of water for
        irrigation could threaten agricultural production, particularly in areas
        where water supplies are already under pressure. Drier soil conditions
        could reduce growth of crops, pasture and trees. Extended or repeated
        period of droughts may cause death of younger tress reducing forest
        productivity.

      - **Increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, cyclones or storms**
        could cause significant damage to forests and disrupt the natural
        ecosystems that have been developed around the forests.

      Significantly slowed GDP growth could impact demand for agriculture
      through its effect on individuals' disposable income. The impact on food
      products is likely to be low due to inelastic demand, and increased demand for
      bioenergy could offset any reduction in food demand.

      Physical risks could affect the range and quality of the ecosystem
      services that agriculture and forestry not only provide, but also rely on.
      These include climate control, flood regulation, biodiversity, pollination
      and nutrient cycling. The agriculture and forestry sectors have already
      adapted to change by introducing new genotypes, varieties, breeds and
      management practices. In a high physical risk scenario, there could be a
      need for more anticipatory adaptation measures.
