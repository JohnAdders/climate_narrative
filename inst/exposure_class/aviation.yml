name: Aviation Underwriting Class
test_report_position: 12
description: |
  The **aviation** underwriting class involves insuring companies engaging in
  economic activity relating to aircrafts. This includes designing,
  manufacturing, supplying, maintaining and operating both manned and unmanned
  aircrafts or parts. It also includes activities related to aircraft supporting
  facilities such as airports and ticket distribution systems.

  Aviation is a complex sector, with long product development cycles and where
  change takes a long time to be implemented. Typical aviation insurance
  policies cover physical damage and loss split across public liability,
  passenger liability, grounded and in-flight hull (covering loss/ damage to the
  aircraft when not in use and when in use), and cargo.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the aviation sector could 
      face increasing operating costs through carbon taxation as well as falling 
      asset values as older and less efficient aircraft could have to be retired 
      earlier than originally planned. This is likely to have an impact on the 
      profitability of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products 
      pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.

      The aviation sector could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand
      for the coming years The changing patterns in energy generation in the
      Delayed transition scenario, driven by late policy action enabling a
      "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by
      COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 and a
      decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> after 2030 to compensate for the inaction
      beforehand, whereas the Divergent scenario results in an immediate but
      divergent reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Policies and regulatory
      frameworks implemented at regional level rather than international level
      or evolving at a different speed depending on the region, could result in
      an un-level playing field for manufacturers and operators. Both these
      scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector
      and therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms and
      conditions, and coverage.

      These scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could 
      result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the aviation sector.

      Changes to carbon emission pricing or taxes and consumer preferences could
      potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Increased operating costs of the underlying companies to be insured
        could impact their demand for insurance.** The significant rise in
        carbon and energy prices could potentially result in financial impacts,
        as aviation firms' carbon emissions face a rising price in the form a
        carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price, especially for airlines
        reliant on fossil-based aviation fuels.
        
        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the price per gigajoule 
        of liquid final energy (liquid fuels from all energy sources; incl. oil 
        products, synthetic fossil fuels from gas and coal, biofuels) for use in 
        transportation increases from ~30 USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) 
        to ~50 USD in the Delayed transition scenario, and to ~55 USD in the Divergent 
        Net Zero scenario, by 2050.

      - **Change in regulations covering energy efficiency standards would lead
        to increasing compliance requirements.** Governments may conclude it
        impossible to decarbonise flying in line with national targets and so
        limit demand by raising the cost of air travel and limiting airport
        capacity, which could lead to changes in the level and type of insurance
        coverage required.

      - **Asset valuations of aviation companies could be re-priced** based on
        the re-adjusted expectations of the use of low-carbon products and
        energy efficient technologies in the future. Higher fuel costs impose a
        risk that older and less efficient aircraft could have to be retired
        earlier than originally planned, resulting in an impairment of their
        residual value.

      - **Changing consumer preferences**, these could lead to changes in
        revenue due to lower customers numbers as a result of change in
        environmental expectations that could impact this underwriting class.
        'Flight shame' could also increase along with a modal shift to (high
        speed) rail, reducing demand for aviation. Slowed GDP growth could
        further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals'
        disposable income.

      The profitability of this sector, in the Disorderly transition
      risk scenarios, could also depend on the relevant companies proactively
      investing in innovation and new technology. For example:

      - Alternative fuel sources (e.g. airlines could invest in Sustainable
        Aviation Fuels (SAF) in the short term whilst more complex solutions
        such as hydrogen and electric aircraft are developed).
        
      In these scenarios, sources of final energy used in the transport sector 
      change dramatically. As use of oil declines, electricity becomes the dominant 
      source of final energy by the end of the century.

      - Energy efficient aircraft and infrastructure (e.g. more efficient
        lighting and heating in hangars and airports)

      - Intelligent routing and smart technologies which support
        climate-optimized flying

      These innovations could contribute to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 
      the aviation sector, however aviation will likely remain a more carbon intensive mode of 
      transport compared to alternatives such as road or rail.  In Disorderly transition risk 
      scenarios, emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> per billion passenger kilometres from aviation passenger 
      transport falls from ~0.07 megatons to ~0.05 megatons in the Delayed transition scenario 
      and to ~0.02 megatons in the Divergent Net Zero scenario.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios also present opportunities 
      for the aviation sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations 
      could lead to positive gains in commercial reputation
      and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could
      proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green strategy as
      well as potentially have knock-on impacts for insurance pricing, terms and
      conditions and coverage.

      The aviation sector could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand
      for the coming years. The changing patterns in energy generation in
      Orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate policy
      reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon
      legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price.

      These are likely to have an impact on the profitability this sector, and
      therefore on the associated insurance products' pricing, terms and
      conditions and coverage, and could generate fast-changing requirements and
      opportunities, as well as potential obstructions, to new product
      development pathways. These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative 
      reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth

      The aviation sector and its associated underwriting class could be highly 
      exposed to high physical risk scenarios due to the projected increase in 
      weather variation and being subject to increasing disruption. This is likely 
      to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the 
      associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage. 
    always: |
      The aviation sector and its associated underwriting class are exposed
      to physical risk. Chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-level and mean
      temperatures) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity
      of weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and
      flooding could severely affect aircraft performance, significantly disrupt
      operations through frequent re-routings and temporary closures of airspace
      and airports, as well as damage infrastructure and aircraft with
      detrimental effects on costs and earnings. Whilst the aviation sector is
      used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high
      physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming could increase
      weather variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to the
      aviation sector which could impact the profitability for these companies
      and therefore could impact the aviation underwriting class as the physical
      effects of climate change could result in increased claims and increased
      premiums potentially resulting in some of the aviation underwriting risks
      becoming either uninsurable or unaffordable.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these vary in line with different temperatures projected 
      for each scenario. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead 
      to a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for aviation
      products and services with knock-on impacts for sector's insurance needs.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the aviation sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      - **Higher average temperatures** can decrease regulated take-off weight
        leading to lower passenger and cargo loads. Increased fuel uplift to
        cope with weather related rerouting could further reduce a flight's
        payload.

      - **Increased frequency of atmospheric turbulences, storms and heatwaves**
        can increase flight times, affect passenger comfort and safety, damage
        aircraft, and induce large scale rerouting or flight cancellations.

      - **Flooding** can damage infrastructure and grounded aircraft. In the 
        Current Policies scenario, river flood depth is projected to increase 
        at an accelerating rate and by 2050 it is 120% higher compared to a
        1986-2006 reference period.

      With a large rise in global temperatures the physical effects of climate
      change could materially alter the existence, attractiveness or viability
      of some destinations, decreasing demand for some aviation services. For
      example, demand could decrease for airline routes serving destinations
      relying on climate conditions for attracting visitors (e.g. snow cover for
      skiing resorts) or destinations impacted by sea level inundation.
      
      Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation
      through its effect on individuals' disposable income. 
      
      There are a number of mitigating actions these companies can take against the 
      high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into their operations 
      against extreme weather events. For example, investing in more resilient solutions
      e.g. continuously review flight plans to ensure optimal routings, standby engineers 
      to reduce technical fault repair time, and increase flood-mitigating construction 
      standards.
