  Sovereign (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to
  support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the
  bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of
  coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. The government bond
  sector is a broad category that includes "sovereign" debt, which is issued and
  generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, German
  Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and
  Government of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government
  bonds. The US, Japan and Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in
  the government bond market.

  Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation,
  known as inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected
  Securities (TIPS). On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal
  is adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in the rate of inflation,
  thus providing a "real," or inflation-adjusted, return. But, unlike other
  bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when real
  interest rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.

  In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes
  subcomponents, such as:

  - Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various
    goals - supporting affordable housing or the development of small
    businesses, for example - through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to
    support their operations. Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central
    government while others are not. Supranational organisations, like the World
    Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
    finance public projects and/or development.

  - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or
    cities - borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools,
    as well as general operations. The market for local government bonds is well
    established in the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other
    developed markets also issue provincial/local government bonds.

  In this report we refer to a '20-notch' sovereign bond rating scale translated from
  S&P's alphabetical standardized rating scale (see Appendix), which is used to outline 
  changes to sovereign bond ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. 
  Impacts of climate change on sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference 
  to the 2021 working paper titled "Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: 
  The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness" from the University of
  Cambridge. This study represents one approach towards quantifying the effects
  of climate change on credit ratings and is illustrative based on a
  hypothetical model. It is not predictive and broader literature on this topic
  is also available.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, delayed or divergent policy reaction, 
      societal change and national energy strategies could lead to significant increases 
      in carbon prices. This could have an impact on sovereign bonds in particular in 
      countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.
    always: |
      In the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action enables a
      "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19.
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030 before policies drive a sharp
      decrease after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. This
      results in smaller increases in carbon taxes compared to an Orderly
      transition scenario until 2030, but significantly higher carbon taxes than
      Orderly scenarios thereafter as countries attempt to make up lost ground.
      In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

      These scenarios could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in
      countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.
      Industries that are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as
      mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel
      demand and increased costs from significantly higher carbon taxes. On the other 
      hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could encourage 
      consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, 
      energy storage, etc., leading to increases in fiscal revenues.

      Scenario analysis of the effects of climate-related risks on the US federal budget
      up to the end of this century has assessed lost revenue for the federal
      government, by transposing projections from global integrated assessment
      models to the US. Climate-related expenditures are expected to range from
      $9 to $28 billion annually (in today's dollars), and revenue losses vary
      between $56 billion and $111 billion.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a reduction in
      GDP growth. Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), 
      the impact of the Divergent Net Zero scenario on the US GDP would be about twice as much
      as the one on the UK by 2050.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with
      carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the
      most vulnerable to transition risk.

      The impact of Disorderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is
      largely dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to
      mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more
      environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption
      patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly
      managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity.
      Depending on the respective country's size of fossil fuel or renewable
      energy sectors, green policies, such as carbon taxes would impact,
      positively or negatively, firms' profitability, which would, in turn,
      impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
      [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf){target="\_blank"}).

      Total GHG emissions in the US in 2021 were 15% below 2005 levels. This 
      trend was primarily driven by the power sector, due to a shift from 
      coal to lower or non-emitting sources of generation, such as natural gas and 
      renewables. Generation from wind and solar continued to grow in 2021, by 29% 
      and 12% respectively compared to 2020.
      
      In 2018, the US became the world's largest producer of crude oil. The production
      of oil in 2021 remained relatively stable, decreasing only by 1% from 2020 levels.
      In response to rising prices and energy security concerns due to Russia's illegal
      invasion of Ukraine, President Biden is now encouraging US oil and gas producers to 
      drill and increase production.

      The US is significantly more dependent on fossil fuel sectors and
      consequently has a lower share of renewable energy compared to global averages or
      its European counterparts.

      **GDP growth effect**

      A change in a country's GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it
      receives. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to 
      a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, disorderly transition 
      could result in significant GDP losses. In these scenarios, world GDP losses from chronic
      physical and transition effects are estimated to be between -4.6% and -4.7% (relative to a 
      baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP impacts from transition
      risks are negative as the speed of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and
      affects consumption and investment. In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and 
      transition risks in 2050. Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs),
      the expected impact of a Disorderly scenario on US GDP, from chronic physical and transition
      effects,  would be significant, ranging from -3.9% to -4% (relative to a baseline with no transition 
      or physical risks) by 2050.

      **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced into the sovereign bond market. No
      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces,
      although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have
      implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 "Rising
      Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign
      Creditworthiness" working paper from the University of Cambridge, in
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios, most developed countries would be
      marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among
      top-rated countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related
      risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top
      ratings as it is easier to downgrade from an AAA rating than a C rating. According to
      the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, the US would have a downgrade below one notch 
      by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the US government by
      approximately US$7.35-11.03bn.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Based on the IIASA NGFS
      Climate Scenarios, REMIND model by 2050, in Orderly transition risk
      scenarios, fossil fuels represent only ~25% to ~40% of global energy demand
      compared to ~85% in 2020. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as
      oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition
      risk.

      The impact of Orderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is
      largely dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to
      mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more

      In August 2022, US President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),
      setting the country's emissions on a trajectory towards meeting its climate commitment 
      to cut GHG emissions in half by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The CAT estimates that 
      implementation of IRA will decrease US emissions to 26-42% below 2005 levels, 
      thus more action is required to meet their climate commitment. 

      **GDP growth effect**

      A change in a country's GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue
      it receives. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead 
      to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, the Orderly 
      transition risk scenarios would generally limit GDP losses. World GDP losses from chronic
      physical and transition effects are estimated to be around -3% (relative to a baseline with 
      no transition or physical risks) by 2050. GDP impacts from transition risk are moderately 
      negative in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon prices 
      and energy costs are only partially offset by the recycling of carbon revenues into government
      investment and lower employment taxes. 

      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of the
      Orderly Net Zero scenario on US GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, 
      ranging from -1.8% to -2.3% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

      **Downgrading of credit ratings**

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced into the sovereign bond market. No
      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces,
      although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have
      implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 "Rising
      Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign

      sovereign bonds.

      In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP
      growth due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural
      resources, lower productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure,
      etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or higher
      insurance premiums. This would result in a material negative impact on GDP
      globally by 2100 and hit governments' finances. Extreme weather events
      such as wildfires, floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent,
      impacting households, businesses, cities, and states. There are also likely
      indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g.
      increased inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via
      biodiversity loss, or to industries' supply chains and international trade.

      The high physical risk scenario could lead to a significant reduction in
      GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on US sovereign bonds.

      As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects
      of climate change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in
      drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of
      human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political
      instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave
      affected areas, this may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even
      within a country, climate change could lead to higher inequality due to
      slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political
      instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between
      countries.

      **GDP growth effect**

      In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures could increase
      across the world by 2.4&deg;C to 3&deg;C compared to pre-industrial levels 
      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher 
      warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions 
      affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level 
      rise, which will consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. It can also 
      change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,
      wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.

      Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of
      increasing temperature on economic output, with productivity peaking at an
      annual average temperature of 13&deg;C and declining strongly at higher
      temperatures. In a high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, unmitigated warming is
      expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes
      by roughly 23% by 2100, relative to scenarios without climate change.

      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues
      are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal 
      expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to
      a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, a Hot house world
      scenario with high physical risk could result in significant GDP losses. In a Hot house 
      world scenario, world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated 
      to be between -5.7% and -6% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.
      World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different temperatures projected for each scenario. 
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Hot house
      world scenario on US GDP from chronic physical and transition effects would be significant, ranging 
      from -5.1% to -5.6% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

      Small and least diversified economies with lower resilience and adaptive
      capacity could count among the most vulnerable countries. For example, in
      the US, certain states (e.g. Florida) and cities (e.g. Miami) would be
      especially exposed to material risks (e.g. via reduced tax revenues and
      greater costs, for example on healthcare and infrastructure or direct
      support to businesses and individuals most adversely impacted).
      Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate
      resilience investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel
      the growth of economic sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms
      of products and services). In the US, the economic costs of natural
      hazards such as drought, flooding, storms, or cyclones would be
      exacerbated.

      significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by
      2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not
      necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries,
      but greater sensitivity of the top ratings as it is easier to downgrade from an AAA
      rating than a C rating. According to the study, in a high physical risk
      scenario, the US would have a downgrade close to five notches by 2100,
      increasing the cost of borrowing for the US government by approximately
      US$63.2-94.8bn.

      In a low physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth

      In a low physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures could increase
      across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels
      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing
      higher warming). These changes could lead

      productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also
      further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
      heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.

      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax 
      revenues are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further
      strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease 
      in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the
      NGFS, Orderly or Disorderly transitions with low physical risk would generally limit GDP losses. 
      In Orderly or Disorderly scenarios, world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects 
      are estimated to be around -3% or -5% respectively (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical 
      risks) by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different temperatures
      projected for each scenario.

      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs),
      the expected impact of Orderly or Disorderly scenarios on US GDP from chronic physical 
      and transition effects would be significant, ranging from -1.8% to -2.3% in an Orderly 
      scenario and -3.9% to -4% in a Disorderly scenario (relative to a baseline with no transition or
      physical risks) by 2050.

      Small and least diversified economies with lower resilience and adaptive
      capacity could count among the most vulnerable countries. For example, in
      the US, certain states (e.g. Florida) and cities (e.g. Miami) would be
      especially exposed to material risks (e.g. via reduced tax revenues and
      greater costs, for example on healthcare and infrastructure or direct
      support to businesses and individuals most adversely impacted).
      Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate
      resilience investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel
      the growth of economic sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms
      of products and services). In the US, the economic costs of natural

      ratings as it is easier to downgrade from an AAA rating than a C rating. According to
      the study, in a low physical risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, the US would have a
      downgrade below one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for
      the US government by approximately US$7.35-11.03bn.
