  The **transport** sector includes companies primarily engaged in providing 
  services to move people or goods, as well as transportation infrastructure. 
  The transport sector consists of subsectors for each mode of transport; air, 
  rail, water, road, and pipeline, as well as a subsector for establishments 
  providing support activities for transport, such as packing, crating, warehousing 
  and storage. 
  
  Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing 
  travel services that support transport, such as travel agents and hotels, 
  as well as establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing 
  of transport equipment without operators.
  
  Companies in the transport sector may, for example, be involved in one or 
  more of the following: trucking, shipping, airline operation, logistics, scenic 
  and sightseeing transport, and transport equipment maintenance.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the transport sector could 
      face increasing operating costs through carbon taxation, falling 
      asset values as older and less efficient infrastructure becomes increasingly obsolete,
      and lower demand as consumers become more 
      conscious of the environmental impacts of services they use. This is likely 
      to have an impact on the profitability of this sector.
    always: |
      The transport sector will continue to play a role in facilitating global 
      trade and meeting customer demand for the coming years. The changing patterns 
      in energy generation in Disorderly transition scenarios, driven by late 
      policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought 
      about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 before 
      rapidly decreasing after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. 
      The Divergent Net Zero scenario results in immediate but divergent CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions reductions. Both these scenarios are likely to have an impact on 
      the profitability of this sector.
      
      Firms could face higher fuel costs, especially those using high carbon fuels. 
      Capital expenditure may need adjusting as investment in infrastructure could 
      be required to pivot firms' business models towards low-carbon fuel use. 
      Firms may also face a change in consumer preferences, with changing environmental 
      expectations potentially decreasing demand. 
      
      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a limited relative 
      reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth 
      in demand for both passenger and goods transport.

    high_materiality: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, there are a number of potential 
      impacts on the transport sector. For example: 

      - **Increased operating costs.** The sharp rise in carbon and energy prices is 
        likely to result in financial impacts, as transport firms' carbon emissions face 
        a rising price in the form a carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price, 
        especially for firms reliant on fossil-based fuels. 
        
        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, by 2050, as carbon price increases, 
        carbon tax paid from transport emissions peaks at ~$1.8 trillion (inflation adjusted 
        to 2010 baseline) per year around 2030 in the Divergent Net Zero scenario, and decreases 
        thereafter as improvements are made to transport emissions intensities. Carbon tax paid 
        from transport emissions reaches ~$1.3 trillion by 2050 in the Delayed transition scenario.

        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the price per gigajoule of liquid 
        final energy (liquid fuels from all energy sources; incl. oil products, 
        synthetic fossil fuels from gas and coal, biofuels) for use in transportation 
        increases from ~28 USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to ~48 USD in the Delayed transition scenario, and 
        to ~53 USD in the Divergent Net Zero scenario.

      - **Change in regulations covering energy efficiency standards could lead
        to increasing compliance requirements.** These changes may require firms 
        to adapt their service, potentially reducing sales (e.g. cruise operators 
        may face efficiency-based speed limits for ships, leading to a less 
        appealing service with reduced itinerary and more sea days).
        
      - **Readjusted capital expenditures**. New investments could be required 
        to modify or replace current transport infrastructure to pivot business 
        models towards a low-carbon economy and integrate renewable energy into 
        transport networks.

      - **Asset valuations could be re-priced** based on the re-adjusted 
        expectations of the use of low-carbon products and energy efficient 
        technologies in the future. Higher fuel costs impose a risk that older and 
        less efficient transport infrastructure could have to be retired earlier 
        than originally planned, resulting in an impairment of their residual value. 

      - **Changing consumer preferences as consumers become more conscious of the 
        environmental impact of services they use**. This could lead to lower demand and 
        reduced revenue for certain modes of transport that will likely take longer to 
        decarbonise, but could present opportunities for other modes. For example, air 
        travel is currently far more carbon intensive than rail travel; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        from air travel are 285 grams per passenger kilometre, whilst emissions from 
        rail travel are 14 grams per passenger kilometre (according to figures published 
        by the [European Environment Agency](https://www.france24.com/en/20190410-aviation-faces-challenge-reduce-pollution){target="\_blank"}). 
        More climate-conscious consumers may experience 'flight shame', decreasing demand 
        for airlines, whilst increasing demand for lower carbon alternatives such as 
        (high speed) rail, provided rail operators have the infrastructure in place to serve 
        the same destinations. 
        
        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, there is a varied rate of decarbonisation 
        between different modes of transport. Between 2020 and 2050, emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> per 
        billion passenger kilometres from road passenger transport falls from ~0.07 megatons 
        to ~0.01 megatons in the Delayed transition scenario and to ~0.002 megatons in the 
        Divergent Net Zero scenario. Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> per billion passenger kilometres from 
        aviation passenger transport falls to a lesser extent, from ~0.07 megatons to ~0.05 
        megatons in the Delayed transition scenario and to ~0.02 megatons in the Divergent 
        Net Zero scenario. Rail emissions are relatively low compared to other modes of transport, 
        and remain that way throughout both scenarios.

        Slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for transport through its effect 
        on individuals' disposable income. 
        
        There is also significant dependence of other sectors on the 
        transport sector as it plays a key role in other firms' supply chains. This 
        magnifies the importance of decarbonising the transport sector as companies who 
        have a high carbon step in their supply chain could lose customers as consumer 
        preferences change. Without decarbonisation of the transport sector, consumers 
        may prefer local alternative goods which rely less on transportation. This could 
        decrease demand for the transport sector. 
        
        In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the profitability of the transport sector 
        could also depend on the relevant companies proactively investing in innovation and 
        new technology. For example:
        
        - Hydrogen and electric powered vehicles. In these 
          scenarios, sources of final energy used in the transport sector change dramatically. 
          As use of oil declines, electricity becomes the dominant source of final energy 
          by the end of the century.

      - Energy efficient modifications to vehicles (e.g. Silverstream air 
        lubrication in watercraft) and supporting infrastructure (e.g. more 
        efficient lighting and heating in hangars and airports).

      - Intelligent routing and smart technologies which optimize routes and speeds 
        to minimise emissions.
        
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, these innovations could contribute 
      to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the transportation sector.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios also present opportunities 
      for the transport sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations 
      could lead to positive gains in commercial reputation
      and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could
      proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green strategy.

      The transport sector could be highly exposed to high physical risk scenarios 
      due to the projected increase in weather variation and being subject to 
      increasing disruption. This is likely to have an impact on the profitability 
      of this sector.
    always: |
      The transport sector is also exposed to physical risk; many firms in this sector 
      operate on networks, with physical facilities, labour forces, and equipment spread 
      over an extensive geographic area. Chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-level and mean 
      temperatures) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather 
      events such as heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding could affect 
      vehicle performance, disrupt operations through frequent re-routings and temporary 
      route closures, as well as damage infrastructure with effects on costs and earnings. 
      Whilst the transport sector is used to responding to and managing changing weather 
      conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming could 
      increase weather variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to the transport 
      sector which could impact the profitability for these companies.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these vary in line with different temperatures projected for each scenario.
      The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for transport
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the transport sector could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
      
      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Higher average temperatures** can affect vehicle performance. For example, 
        airlines could have to decrease regulated take-off weight leading to lower 
        passenger and cargo loads, and trains may have to run slower due to the increased 
        risk of buckled rails as steel rails expand in the heat.

      - **Rising sea levels**, as well as higher average temperatures, could materially 
        alter the existence, attractiveness or viability of some destinations, decreasing 
        demand for passenger transport. For example, demand could decrease for airline 
        routes serving destinations relying on climate conditions for attracting visitors 
        (e.g. snow cover for skiing resorts) or destinations impacted by sea level 
        inundation.
      
      **Acute Impacts**

      - **More regular flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather events** can cause 
        damage to infrastructure, vehicles and cargo, and induce disruption through large 
        scale rerouting or journey cancellations. 
        
      Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for transport through 
      its effect on individuals' disposable income, which results in lower spending on 
      both passenger and goods transport. 
        
      There are a number of mitigating actions these companies can take against the physical 
      risks mentioned above to build resiliency into their operations against extreme 
      weather events. For example, investing in more resilient solutions e.g. continuously 
      review procedures to ensure optimal routings, standby engineers to reduce technical 
      fault repair time, and increase flood-mitigating construction standards.
