name: Motor Underwriting Class
description: |
  The **Motor** underwriting class involves insuring cars, trucks, motorcycles, 
  and other road vehicles. Motor insurance typically covers drivers for third
  party damage caused by their road vehicle such as damage to other vehicles or
  property and injuries to other people, damage to or loss of their road
  vehicle, and injury to the driver themselves. Cover is usually split across
  these separate expenses, with most countries requiring a minimum of
  third-party cover by law.

  Motor insurance includes individual policies for private vehicle owners as
  well as fleet policies for companies that operate multiple vehicles as part of
  their business.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the motor sector and its associated 
      underwriting class could be disrupted by the automotive companies' proactively 
      investing in innovation and new technology and changing customer preferences. 
    always: |
      While motor insurance could continue to play a role in meeting customer
      demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation in
      the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late policy action enabling a
      "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by
      COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 before
      rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon prices are increased to compensate
      for the inaction beforehand.

      In the Divergent Net Zero scenario, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions start to be
      reduced immediately but divergently. Policies and regulatory frameworks
      implemented at regional level rather than international level or evolving
      at a different speed depending on the region, could result in in an
      un-level playing field for motor sector.

      Both these scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability of
      the motor sector and the associated insurance products' pricing, terms and
      conditions, and coverage. These scenarios could also lead to a reduction
      in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth in
      demand for motor insurance.
    high_materiality: |
      In the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, there are a number
      of potential impacts on the motor sector and the underwriting class. For
      example:

      - **Increased total claims cost due to an increase in the cost of
        repair**. A rapid increase in carbon price could have a significant
        impact on the supply chain of vehicles and affect the price of parts,
        particularly those made of steel or hydrocarbon derived plastics, which
        could increase claims costs significantly alongside increased costs to
        operate associated processes such as paint booths or waste disposal. In
        the Disorderly transition risk scenarios there is a shift from
        internal combustion engine vehicles towards electric vehicles (and
        possibly hydrogen or other zero-carbon fuel types). This has impacts on
        replacement and repair costs, increasing costs of claims in the short
        term as repair networks adapt to deal with batteries and electric motors
        instead of internal combustion engines.

      - **Changing consumer preferences and revenue**. In the
        Disorderly transition risk scenarios, internal combustion
        engine vehicle ownership could become significantly more expensive,
        causing many people to give up their vehicles and cancel cover, without
        being able to afford an electric replacement. There is potential for
        models of car ownership changing as transition to low a carbon economy
        could encourage more active travel (walking and cycling) and use of
        public transport which could lead to a rise in shared-ownership vehicles
        (such as zip car) and fewer personal cars. This could mean that the
        insurance model shifts from issuing policies to individuals and more to
        a fleet or business-to-business model, with manufacturers providing the
        insurance to companies as part of a wider package of services with the
        vehicle. Increases in petrol costs arising from paying a price on carbon 
        emissions could also accelerate the transition towards electric vehicles. 

      - Extremely high demand for new electric vehicles could also lead to very
        long lead times, reducing the number of road vehicle owners along with
        demand for associated insurance products. Slowed GDP growth could
        further impact demand for road vehicles and their associated insurance
        products through its effect on individuals' disposable income resulting
        in a reduction in growth of number of vehicle owners.

      - **Changes to the motor sector due to new technologies**. Although
        autonomous vehicles are distinct from electric vehicles, many electric
        vehicles' manufactures include autonomous driving features, and an
        increase in the number of electric vehicles is likely to increase the
        usage of these features. Firms may want to consider the potential change
        in insurance products as there could be a shift in accountability for
        collisions from drivers to manufacturers whilst autonomous driving
        software is active. An increase in the proportion of electric vehicles
        on the road may also be associated with cover expanding to include
        charging cables and chargers owned by the vehicle owner.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, Primary energy prices 
      (i.e. the spot price at the global market) remain depressed throughout the 
      scenario horizon, while secondary energy prices (i.e. paid by large scale 
      consumers) rise in line with the carbon price.

      The motor underwriting class is likely to be impacted by steady 
      decarbonization in transport. Within both freight and passenger vehicles, 
      the portion of electric vehicles could increase in Disorderly 
      transition risk scenarios.

      The profitability of the motor sector and its associated underwriting
      class, in the Disorderly transition risk scenarios, could also
      depend on the relevant automotive companies proactively investing in
      innovation and new technology. For example, expansion of affordable
      low-carbon products and services, and electric vehicle charging networks. 
      These innovations could contribute to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions in the transportation sector.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios also present opportunities for 
      the motor sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations could lead to 
      positive gains in commercial reputation
      and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could
      proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green strategy as
      well as potentially have knock-on impacts for insurance pricing, terms and
      conditions and coverage.

      While motor insurance firms could continue to play a role in meeting
      customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy
      generation in Orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate
      policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon
      legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. This would, in turn, lead to an increase 
      in the carbon price due to, for example, a smooth transition away from 
      Internal Combustion Engine vehicles towards electric vehicles (and possibly 
      hydrogen or other zero-carbon fuel types). These are likely to have an 
      impact on replacement and on repair costs, and increased costs of claims 
      in the short term as repair networks adapt to deal with batteries and 
      electric motors instead of engines. These could also impact the profitability 
      of the motor sector, and therefore on the associated insurance products' 
      pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.

      The Orderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a limited
      relative reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate

      In the Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios, there are a number of
      potential impacts on the motor sector and the underwriting class. For
      example:

      - **Increased total claims cost due to an increase in the cost of
        repair**. Rising carbon price could impact the supply chain of vehicles
        and affect the price of parts, particularly those made of steel or
        hydrocarbon derived plastics, which could increase claims costs

        booths or waste disposal. In the Orderly transition risk scenarios
        there is a smooth transition away from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)
        vehicles towards electric vehicles (and possibly hydrogen or other

      Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) remain 
      above 2020 levels but secondary energy prices (i.e. paid by large scale 
      consumers) rise as the increased operating costs from paying a price on 
      carbon emissions is partially passed to downstream consumers.

      The motor sector is exposed to high physical risk scenarios due to the projected 
      increase in weather variation and being subject to increasing disruption. This is 
      likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the 
      associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.
    always: |
      In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in
      increased disruption that could have an impact on the motor sector and its
      underwriting class. Chronic effects (such as raised mean temperature) and
      acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events
      (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could
      impact frequency and size of the claims. This could result in future
      policyholders becoming more expensive to insure.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios
      over time. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for motor
      sector and insurance.
    high_materiality: |
      In high physical risk scenarios, the increases in chronic climate effects
      (such as temperature variation and weather events) could pose significant
      challenges that in turn could impact the motor underwriting class. The
      following examples illustrate how the motor underwriting class could be
      impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      - **Higher than average temperature** could impact global supply chains,
        with car and part manufacturers price being directly impacted, creating
        delays and increasing costs of repairs.

      - **Flooding, cyclones and other extreme weather events** can damage
        infrastructure and vehicles. More frequent and intense events could lead
        to a larger than anticipated total claims cost.

      Extreme weather events could also impact on global supply chains creating
      delays and increasing costs of repairs. Increasing likelihood of car and
      part manufacturers being directly impacted by weather events themselves
      creating large delays. More general disruption from flooding and storms
      add to delays. The impact of physical effects could vary by location; in
      the UK, milder winters may reduce the number of claims related to ice.
      Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for vehicles
      and their associated insurance products through its effect on individuals'
      disposable income resulting in a reduction in growth of number of vehicle
      owners.

      Even in low physical risk scenarios, the increases in chronic climate
      effects (such as temperature variation and weather events) could pose
      significant challenges that in turn could impact the motor underwriting
      class.

      The following examples illustrate how the motor underwriting class could

      - **Higher than average temperature** could impact on global supply
        chains, with car and part manufacturers price being directly impacted,

      The impact of physical effects could vary by location; in the UK, milder
      winters may reduce the number of claims related to ice. Firms should
      consider detailed analysis of their claims supply chain to identify the
      most carbon-intensive areas, which would be most impacted. This could give
      a more accurate picture of how the Disorderly transition risk scenarios impact 
      the business.
