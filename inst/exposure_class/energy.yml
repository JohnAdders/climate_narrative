name: Energy Underwriting Class
test_report_position: 14
description: |
  The **energy** underwriting class involves insuring companies engaging in 
  economic activity related to the supply of energy, including those in oil, gas, 
  coal, nuclear and renewable industries. Where relevant, this includes insuring upstream 
  energy operations, such as exploration and extraction, as well as downstream operations 
  such as storage (e.g. tank farms and terminals), refinement, power generation (e.g.
  power plants, renewables), and distribution (e.g. gas pipelines) operations.
  
  Firms in the energy sector very often operate in an extremely risky environment, depending 
  on complex and expensive infrastructure, in many cases sited in hostile locations.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, energy sources change dramatically, 
      resulting in demand for insurance covering oil, gas and coal operations 
      decreasing, with rising pressure on insurers to decline cover. Demand for 
      insurance covering renewable energy is likely to increase.
    always: |
      The changing patterns in energy generation in Disorderly transition scenarios, 
      driven by late policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of the economic 
      crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 
      before rapidly decreasing after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. 
      The Divergent Net Zero scenario involves an immediate but divergent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
      reduction. Both these scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability 
      of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products' pricing, terms 
      and conditions and coverage, and could generate fast-changing requirements and 
      opportunities.
      
      Demand for carbon intensive energy forms, such as fossil fuels, 
      could decline, posing a risk to firms without adequate transition 
      plans, and result in an associated decline in demand for insurance covering these 
      energy forms. Demand for renewables and sustainable energy forms, such as solar, wind 
      hydro and biomass, could increase, presenting an opportunity for these types of energy 
      insurers.
      
      These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. 
      This could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the energy 
      sector and its associated underwriting class. 

    high_materiality: |
      The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and legislation could
      potentially result in one or more of the following impacts:

      - **Reduced revenues**. As carbon prices increase and consumers switch to 
        low carbon/electrified alternatives for cars, heating etc, demand for 
        fossil fuels decreases, with knock on effects for cover of carbon intensive 
        energy industries. In Disorderly transition risk scenarios the demand for coal, 
        oil and gas falls, from over 450 exajoules (EJ) a year to between ~100 and 200 EJ a year, 
        with coal demand almost completely phased out between 2035 and 2040.

      - **Changes in underwriting rules** regarding excluded or stranded asset types, 
        including fossil fuel activities and assets. These risks have already prompted a 
        number of insurers to stop insuring coal.
        
      - **Increased regulatory oversight and sanctions.** Non-compliant insurers may face 
        increased regulatory oversight and sanctions. There is also potential legal or 
        other liability risks, and associated reputational risks, due to inadequate transition 
        strategies. 
        
      - **Inability to secure reinsurance coverage** (either availability of capital, or 
        exclusions) for insured risks which are not in line with industry Net Zero commitments.
      
      - **Opportunities for new products or lines of business** from new risk transfer 
        requirements for the renewable energy industry (comprehensive products are required for 
        renewables due to their complex financing and ownership structures).
      
      - **Changing consumer behaviour**. Although widespread electrification is likely to increase 
        demand for electricity in these scenarios, there may be a shift in the supply business as 
        households, municipalities, and companies produce their own green energy and become more 
        energy autonomous. Firms may want to consider the potential change in energy insurance 
        products that results.
      
      The profitability of the energy underwriting class could also depend on the 
      relevant companies proactively addressing transition risks through mitigating 
      actions. For example: 
      
      - Developing a clear net-zero underwriting strategy based on industry standards 
        such as the [Net Zero Insurance Alliance](https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-insurance/){target="\_blank"}.
      
      - Ensuring underwriting rules and policies are aligned to corporate and industry 
        wide Net Zero objectives.
      
      - Encouraging policy holder's approaches to risk mitigation and transition strategies 
        through increased knowledge transfer and remediation advisories, as well as new 
        product development, for example to support a low carbon transition to agreed timescales 
        for high GHG emitting assets and activities.

      In the high physical risk scenario, the projected increase in weather 
      variation and resulting damage and disruption to energy firms could impact 
      associated insurance products' pricing, terms and conditions, as well as coverage.
    always: |
      The energy sector and its associated underwriting class are exposed to 
      physical risk. Chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels and mean temperatures) 
      and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events 
      such as heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding could damage infrastructure 
      and cause widespread disruptions with negative effects on costs and earnings. 
      
      Whilst the energy sector is used to responding to and managing changing 
      weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and 
      global warming could increase weather variations. This could lead to significant 
      disruption within the energy sector which could impact the profitability of these 
      companies and therefore impact the energy underwriting class. The physical effects 
      of climate change could result in increased claims and increased premiums, 
      potentially resulting in some energy underwriting risks becoming either uninsurable 
      or unaffordable.
      
      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the scenarios 
      and these vary in line with different temperatures projected for each scenario. The 
      high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a significant GDP 
      impact which could negatively impact demand for the energy sector and its associated 
      underwriting class.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the energy sector and underwriting class 
      could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts** 
      
      - **Rising sea levels** could cause disruption to offshore and coastal 
        infrastructure especially when compounded with storm surge events, such as those 
        generated by cyclones. For example, hurricane Katrina caused the total 
        shutdown of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico for 6 months (for further detail 
        see [IIGCC oil and gas document](https://iigcc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Oil-and-Gas.pdf){target="\_blank"}).
      
      - **Higher average temperatures** could reduce demand for energy used for heating, 
        particularly natural gas demand.
      
      - **Water stress/long-term drought** could lead to competition between energy 
        companies for water resources, and potentially result in increased environmental 
        regulation focusing on protecting water supply and quality. This could add costs 
        for water-intensive energy industries, such as fossil fuel and nuclear, which use 
        large quantities of water in their cooling processes. Renewables typically use 
        less water so would not be as impacted.
      
      - **Thawing permafrost** could lead to areas of pipeline subsidence, causing damage 
        and associated increased maintenance costs.
        
      - **Changes in water temperature** may impact hydropower and thermal power generation
          due to reduced streamflow and less access to cooling water.         

      **Acute Impacts**
      
      - **More regular flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather events** could cause 
        disruption and damage facilities. These conditions could also lead to spills/leaks, 
        such as flood-induced dispersal of salt and chemicals from coal seam gas mines onto 
        farming land, resulting in additional clean-up costs.
      
      Although the materiality of these risks will vary based on geography, energy 
      infrastructure is often located in hostile environments. For example, many oil drilling 
      rigs are located in warm offshore areas (business from Gulf of Mexico offshore risks 
      accounts for approximately [25%](https://www.cii.co.uk/media/4043851/ch12_energy.pdf){target="\_blank"}
      of annual global energy premiums) where they are particularly vulnerable to storm damage. 
      Renewable energy infrastructure is also often prone to the elements by necessity (e.g. 
      solar farms are most effective in hot and dry environments which are also susceptible 
      to wildfires; wind turbines are most effective in high wind areas susceptible to storms).
      
      Uncertainty surrounding the future changes in frequency and intensity of weather events 
      could lead to increased technical rates and premiums, and potentially unaffordability 
      of insurance. At the same time, there is also an increased risk of reinsurance failure 
      due to underestimation of potential losses, particularly aggregate loss from multiple 
      occurring extremes.
      
      There are many actions that companies can take to adapt to climate change and reduce 
      the physical risks mentioned above. These include investing in more resilient 
      infrastructure (e.g. to build resilience to cyclones upstream energy firms could 
      improve drainage systems on offshore rigs; downstream firms could develop underground 
      power line networks) as well as more robust design and construction standards. To 
      reduce the impact of rising sea levels, the position of new facilities should consider 
      climate change to minimise the risk of damage caused by flooding. However, adaptation 
      becomes more difficult and costly the greater the extent of the temperature rises and 
      climate change, especially as the consequences become harder to predict.
