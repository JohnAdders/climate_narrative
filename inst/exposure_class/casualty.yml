name: Casualty Underwriting Class
test_report_position: 18
description: |
  The **Casualty** underwriting class covers legal liabilities from a number
  of causes and lines of business including Product Liability, Public Liability, 
  Directors & Officers, Employers' Liability and others. Liability risks could arise
  for insurance firms from parties who have suffered loss and damage from climate change,
  and then seek to recover losses from others who they believe may have been responsible. 
  Where such claims are successful, those parties against whom the claims are made may seek
  to pass on some or all of the cost to insurance firms under third-party liability contracts 
  such as professional indemnity or directors' and officers' insurance. 
  (Prudential Regulation Authority, 2015).

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the failure to consider, mitigate or adapt 
      to climate change-related risk factors (if insured parties have not sufficiently 
      accounted for climate change risk factors in their acts, omissions or decision-making) 
      could become the subject of shareholder actions against corporations and their directors 
      for breaches of statutory or fiduciary duties or for loss of share value (particularly as 
      fossil fuel assets become devalued). There are also risks that some types of 
      business shrink in size through the transition, reducing the top-line premium 
      income; while other sectors may see growth.      
    always: |
      Climate change risk management is a board-level governance issue and
      directors have to be actively involved in establishing and monitoring
      strategies to reduce wide-ranging climate-related carbon asset risk which
      are relevant for corporate risk or return. The failure to consider, mitigate or
      adapt to climate change-related risk factors (if insured parties have not 
      sufficiently accounted for climate change risk factors in their acts, 
      omissions or decision-making) could become the subject of shareholder 
      actions against corporations and their directors for breaches of statutory 
      or fiduciary duties or for loss of share value (particularly as fossil fuel 
      assets become devalued). 

      While the shift away from carbon-intensive businesses may present some
      challenges, there are growing opportunities through technological
      innovations and commercialisation in areas such as carbon capture and
      storage, renewable energy generation and electrification of
      transportation, among others. Broadly speaking, businesses advancing these
      initiatives could require many of the same insurance coverages as
      carbon-intensive sectors and serve as potential underwriting and
      investment opportunities. There are risks that some types of business shrink 
      in size through the transition, reducing premium income; while other sectors 
      may see growth for new companies to fill the gaps. Exposures to carbon-intensive 
      industries are likely to be significantly affected and those markets could 
      shrink significantly while also incurring large losses through the transition 
      and in the years afterwards (as stakeholders continue to take legal action
      against Directors).
    high_materiality: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, immediate policy
      reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, carbon and other
      legislation could drive a fraught transition to a low carbon economy. The
      changing patterns in energy generation in the Delayed transition scenario,
      driven by late policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of
      the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 to
      compensate for the inaction beforehand. The Divergent Net Zero scenario
      results in immediate but divergent reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

      From a policy perspective, actions to reduce carbon emissions could change
      the scope and the pricing of Casualty policies. For example, the ability
      to offer some lines of business such as surety (insurer guarantees
      performance of a contractual obligation) and credit (insurer guarantees
      payment of credit extended to a party) to carbon-intensive sectors could
      be significantly affected if public policies curb carbon emissions
      dramatically. There is also widespread impacts to carbon-intensive
      industries and sectors. There is a high chance of litigation on behalf of
      employees made redundant through the transition, or from shareholders and
      other stakeholders for mismanagement of firms (where the firms and directors 
      may be liable for failing to act to mitigate the risks of transition). 
      Defence costs are incurred for these cases, and with a wide range of 
      litigation across different topics there is a higher chance of losing 
      some of the cases.
      
      The graph below shows how consumption and energy costs may change in a 
      transition scenario which could be considered as a starting point for the 
      impacts on demand and costs for companies that fail to adapt to the transition.

      The sudden shift to a low-carbon economy could lead to wide-ranging
      changes in the nature and mix of businesses and can cause established
      customers to shrink rapidly while new companies grow to fill the gaps.
      This creates a big opportunity to gain new customers while customer
      retention is strained.

      have done so in a manner that is misleading, or have otherwise not

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, additional risks for Casualty
      insurance are fairly low as immediate policy reaction, societal change,
      national energy strategies, and carbon legislation could lead to a smooth
      transition to a low carbon economy and an immediate and smooth reduction
      in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price. From

    exec_description: |
      In high physical risk scenarios, action against insured parties could be 
      for failure to mitigate climate change risks if the insured parties are being 
      held responsible for the physical impacts of climate change, such as through 
      emissions of greenhouse gases. 
    always: |
      The casualty underwriting class are also exposed to physical risk. Chronic
      effects (e.g. raised sea-levels and mean temperatures) and acute effects
      due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as
      heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding could lead to increasing 
      disruption for this underwriting class as a result of increased
      claims and premiums and could therefore impact the profitability of this
      underwriting class. Action against insured parties could be for failure to 
      mitigate climate change risks if the insured parties are being held responsible 
      for the physical impacts of climate change, such as through emissions of 
      greenhouse gases. 
      
      As the value of loss and damage arising from climate change grows, litigation 
      risk is also likely to increase. For example, in New York City in January 2018, 
      a lawsuit was announced against five major oil companies, seeking to collect 
      billions of dollars in damages to pay for city efforts to cope with the effects 
      of climate change (Savage, 2019).
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the Casualty underwriting class
      could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      - **Increasing claims**. Under commercial general liability (CGL)
        policies, insurers typically cover damages such as bodily injury or
        property damage. Therefore, insurers are potentially vulnerable to a
        broad variety of liability claims for both personal injury and property
        damage as a result of climate change.

      - **Increasing temperatures**, and rising likelihood of wet-bulb
        temperature events, could make working outdoors more dangerous and could
        increase claims for employers and public liability lines.

      - An increase in the **severity of storms, higher water levels, and more
        severe droughts** could lead to even more insurance coverage litigation.
        Research could attribute losses due to climate change to emissions. This
        may lead to increasing legal action taken by groups that suffer from
        said losses against firms responsible for historic emissions. Defence
        costs for litigation are incurred with potential for claims to be
        successful.

      For material exposures to employer's liability and public liability,
      exposures that include significant amounts of outdoor activity (or more
      exposures in geographies that are already much hotter) are more likely to
      be affected by a high physical risk scenario. Weather events increase across the 
      economy. Specific events that could lead to insured losses could increase more rapidly, 
      for example, while productivity gradually reduces due to heat stress, heat stress
      injuries leading to litigation against employers will occur in the most extreme heat 
      events if employers haven't taken adequate action to protect employees. Similarly, 
      exposure to wildfire damage increases in general but specific exposures could be more vulnerable.
      (however in the UK this increase may be relatively subdued).

      For material exposures to carbon-intensive industries there is significant
      risk of increasing litigation against firms for their part in historic
      emissions which have caused damage to property or livelihoods. For
      example, after Hurricane Harvey, lawsuits were filed against oil and gas
      operators in Houston for property damage that occurred in conjunction with
      petrochemical spills during the storm. The pressure created by litigation,
      regardless of its success or failure, has already affected the regulatory
      environment. Companies and insurers should hence consider this changing
      regulatory landscape. They should prepare for a potential increase in
      climate change-related claims. Although most cases are dismissed by courts
      due to lack of causality or standing, the global trend is pushing
      boundaries, and claimants are bringing novel and creative legal arguments
      which courts might be willing to follow.
