  Sovereign (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to
  support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the
  bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of
  coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. The government bond
  sector is a broad category that includes "sovereign" debt, which is issued and
  generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, German
  Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and
  Government of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government
  bonds. The US, Japan and Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in
  the government bond market.

  Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation,
  known as inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected
  Securities (TIPS). On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal
  is adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in the rate of inflation,
  thus providing a "real," or inflation-adjusted, return. But, unlike other
  bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when real
  interest rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.

  In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes
  subcomponents, such as:

  - Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various
    goals - supporting affordable housing or the development of small
    businesses, for example - through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to
    support their operations. Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central
    government while others are not. Supranational organisations, like the World
    Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
    finance public projects and/or development.

  - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or
    cities - borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools,
    as well as general operations. The market for local government bonds is well
    established in the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other
    developed markets also issue provincial/local government bonds.

  In this paper we refer to a '20-notch' sovereign bond rating scale translated from
  S&P's alphabetical standardized rating scale (see Appendix), which is used to 
  outline changes to sovereign bond ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. 
  Impacts of climate change on sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference 
  to the 2021 working paper titled "Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The 
  Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness" from the University of
  Cambridge. This study represents one approach towards quantifying the effects
  of climate change on credit ratings and is illustrative based on a
  hypothetical model. It is not predictive and broader literature on this topic
  is also available.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, delayed or divergent policy 
      reaction, societal change and national energy strategies could lead to 
      significant increases in carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
      sovereign bonds in particular in countries with a strong level of dependence 
      on fossil fuel energy sources.
    always: |
      In the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action enables a
      "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19.
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030 before policies drive a
      sharp decrease after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. This
      results in smaller increases in carbon taxes compared to Orderly
      transition scenarios until 2030, but significantly higher carbon taxes
      thereafter as countries attempt to make up lost ground. In the Divergent
      Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to
      occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

      These scenarios could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in
      countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.
      Industries that are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as
      mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel
      demand and increased costs from significantly higher carbon taxes. On the other hand, 
      government spending (through subsidies and investment) could encourage consumer spending 
      and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading to 
      increases in fiscal revenues. The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a reduction in
      GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on UK sovereign bonds.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with
      carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the
      most vulnerable to transition risk. 
      
      The impact of Disorderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely 
      dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate 
      these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more environmentally 
      friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns can help economies 
      transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy could 
      lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the respective country's 
      size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, such as 
      carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms' profitability, 
      which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
      [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf){target="\_blank"}).

      The UK electricity sector has been rapidly decarbonising in recent years,
      as policy has supported renewables deployment and driven coal out of the electricity mix.
      Power sector emissions fell by 63% between 2011 â€“ 2021. Coal provided only 2% of electricity 
      generation in 2021, down from 40% a decade ago. The share of biomass in the electricity generation
      mix has also been increasing, bioelectricity provided 13% of generation in 2021, up from
      3% a decade earlier. 
      
      In 2020 the total share of renewable energy in total electricity generation rose to 43%,
      up from 38% in 2019, well above the global average.

      In 2019, the UK committed to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Since then, it has increased 
      the ambition of its 2030 NDC to align with this long-term target, aiming to reduce emissions to 68% below 1990 
      levels by 2030. To support this the UK has committed to a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035, and will ban
      fossil fuelled car sales from 2030.

      However, there are some key weaknesses in the UK's climate policy approach, for example lack of policy around 
      increasing energy efficiency in homes.

      **GDP growth effect**

      A change in a country's GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it receives. Assuming taxation
      rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates 
      from the NGFS, disorderly transition could result in significant GDP losses. In these scenarios, world GDP losses
      from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated to be between -4.6 and -4.7% (relative to a baseline 
      with no transition or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP impacts from transition risk are negative as the speed 
      of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment.

      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Disorderly scenario
      on UK GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, ranging from -1.9% to -2% (relative 
      to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

      **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. No
      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces,
      although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have
      implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 "Rising
      Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign
      Creditworthiness" working paper from the University of Cambridge, in
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios, most developed countries would be
      marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among
      top-rated countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related
      risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top
      ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. According to the study, 
      in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, the UK would have a downgrade of around 
      one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the UK government by 
      approximately US$2-3bn.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Based on the IIASA NGFS
      Climate Scenarios, REMIND model by 2050, in Orderly transition risk
      scenarios, fossil fuels represent only ~27% of global energy demand
      compared to ~83% in 2020. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as
      oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition
      risk.

      The impact of Orderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues
      is largely dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to
      mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more
      environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption

      or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP impacts from transition risk are moderately negative in the Net Zero 2050
      scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are only partially offset by
      the recycling of carbon revenues into government investment and lower employment taxes.
     
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of an Orderly scenario 
      on UK GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects,  would be significant, ranging from -1% to -1.1% (relative

      In the high physical risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine GDP growth due

      sovereign bonds.

      In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP
      growth due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural
      resources, lower productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure,
      etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or higher
      insurance premiums. This would result in a material negative impact on GDP
      globally by 2100 and hit governments' finances. Extreme weather events
      such as wildfires, floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent,
      impacting households, businesses, cities and states. There are also likely
      indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g.
      increased inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via
      biodiversity loss, or to industries' supply chains and international trade.

      The high physical risk scenario could lead to a significant reduction in
      GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on UK sovereign bonds.

      As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects
      of climate change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in
      drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of
      human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political
      instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave
      affected areas, this may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even
      within a country, climate change could lead to higher inequality due to
      slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political
      instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between
      countries.

      **GDP growth effect**

      In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures could increase
      across the world by 2.4&deg;C to 3&deg;C compared to pre-industrial levels 
      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher 
      warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions 
      affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level 
      rise, which will consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. It can also 
      change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,
      wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.

      Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of
      increasing temperature on economic output, with productivity peaking at an
      annual average temperature of 13&deg;C and declining strongly at higher
      temperatures. In a high physical risk scenario, unmitigated warming is
      expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes
      by roughly 23% by 2100, relative to scenarios without climate change.

      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues 
      are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal 
      expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to 
      a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, a hot house world 
      scenario with high physical risk could result in significant GDP losses. In a hot house 
      world scenario, world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated 
      to be between --5.7% and -6% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks)
      by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different temperatures projected
      for each scenario. Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), 
      the expected impact of a hot house world scenario on UK GDP, from chronic physical and transition
      effects,  would be significant, ranging from -2.2% to -2.3% (relative to a baseline with no transition 
      or physical risks) by 2050.

      high physical risk scenario, most developed countries would be
      significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by
      2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not
      necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries,
      but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA
      rating than a C rating. According to the study, in a high physical risk
      (RCP 8.5) scenario, the UK would have a downgrade exceeding three notches by 2100,
      increasing the cost of borrowing for the UK government by approximately
      US$7.6-11.3bn.
