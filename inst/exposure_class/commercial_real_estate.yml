  The commercial real estate sector covers companies that are primarily engaged
  in renting or leasing real estate to others, managing real estate for others,
  selling or buying real estate for others, providing other real estate related
  services, such as appraisal services.

  This sector includes equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that are
  primarily engaged in leasing buildings, dwellings, or other real estate
  property to others. This sector also includes firms involved in:

  - Acting as lessors of buildings that are both used and not used as residences
    or dwellings, such as single-family homes, apartment buildings, and town
    homes:

    - Firms acting as lessors of buildings that are used as residences or
      dwellings are owner lessors and establishments renting real estate and
      then acting as lessors in subleasing it to others.

    - Firms acting as lessors of buildings that are not used as residences or
      dwellings including owner-lessors of non-residential buildings, establishments 
      renting real estate and then acting as lessors in subleasing it to others, and 
      establishments providing full-service office space, whether on a lease or 
      service contract basis.

  - Renting or leasing space to others for self-storage. These establishments
    provide secure space (i.e., rooms, compartments, lockers, containers, or
    outdoor space) where clients can store and retrieve their goods.

  - Acting as lessors of real estate (except buildings), such as manufactured
    home (i.e., mobile home) sites, vacant lots, and grazing land.

  - Providing real estate services (except lessors of real estate and offices of
    real estate agents and brokers). Included in this industry group are
    establishments primarily engaged in activities, such as managing real estate
    for others and appraising real estate.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the commercial real estate sector 
      could be impacted by an increase in carbon price and through the cost of complying with 
      "low carbon/green" building criteria which in turn could affect the profitability in this 
      sector. In these scenarios a limited relative reduction in GDP growth will also 
      impact the sector. 
    always: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the demand for commercial real
      estate sector is likely to increase.

      While the commercial real estate sector could continue to play a role in
      meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in
      energy generation in the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late
      policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of the economic
      crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon
      prices are increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the
      Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both these scenarios are likely to have a
      significant impact on the profitability of this sector. The increase in
      the carbon price as well as a change to the demand in the quality of the
      real estate product (e.g. emissions from the construction and fabric of
      the building, energy efficiency performance and low carbon technology
      (especially heating and cooling)) are likely to influence the
      profitability of this sector, and could produce a sudden and extreme 
      transition between profit and loss. The flexibility to adjust rapidly 
      and/or prepare for these changes will be a key consideration in the size 
      of risk and opportunity for individual assets and for portfolios.

      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a relative
      reduction in GDP growth. This could partially offset growth in demand for
      the Commercial Real Estate sector.

    high_materiality: |
      The transition changes could translate into financial impacts:

      - **Increased revenues** for "low carbon / green" buildings meeting demand
        as companies have to decarbonise their own operations.

      - **Decreased revenues from, and stranding of, assets** that fail to meet
        customer criteria and/or government regulations on energy efficiency,
        use and HVAC technologies.

      - **Changes or disruption to revenues** due to changing customer base from
        transition exposure (can reduce or increase revenues depending upon net
        exposure)

      - **Increase in repair, refurbishment and operating costs** due to
        government regulations, taxation and meeting customer criteria.

      - **Increased revenues** from retrofits and conversions to low carbon /
        energy efficient buildings.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, buildings become less carbon intense;
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to energy consumption per billion meters squared of floor space 
      decreases from ~14 megatons to between 0 and ~2 megatons by 2050.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, as carbon price increases, carbon tax paid from buildings'
      emissions peaks at ~$640 billion (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) around 2025 in the Divergent 
      Net Zero scenario, and at ~$360 billion around 2035 in the Delayed transition scenario. Carbon tax 
      paid begins to decrease thereafter as improvements are made to buildings' emissions intensities.

      The materiality of the exposures is very granular dependent upon the
      attributes of the property and the vibrancy of both the local and global
      economies. Where local economies are particularly exposed to revenues
      (directly or indirectly) from high transition risk industries, such as
      coal, oil & gas extraction, or from industries with transition risks arising 
      from their supply chains, such as deforestation-related reputational risks 
      in the supply chains companies (for more 
      information see [Deforestation-Driven Reputation Risk Could Become Material for FMCGs](https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/deforestation-driven-reputation-risk-could-become-material-for-fmcgs/){target="\_blank"}),
      then knock-on effects would be expected to revenues and occupancy. 
      
      Mitigating steps can include:

      - diversification of client base

      - supporting local attempts to bring new business lines to the areas at
        high transition risk

      - divestment of potentially stranded assets

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, the demand for commercial real
      estate sector is likely to increase. While the commercial real estate
      sector could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand for the
      coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation in these 
      scenarios, driven by immediate policy reaction, societal change, national 
      energy strategies, and carbon legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth 
      reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050.

      Since the sector is highly reliant on revenues attached to assets at

      exposed to the physical impacts of climate change. In addition to direct damage, 
      extreme temperatures can materially impact the revenues of assets that are not

      Since the sector is highly reliant on revenues attached to assets at fixed 
      locations, the commercial real estate services sector is particularly exposed 
      to the physical impacts of climate change: these include chronic effects 
      (e.g. raised sea-levels) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and

      Property values themselves may be impacted by the occurrence, or risk of
      occurrence, of climate-related events. This can manifest itself as:

      - Property prices decline after climate events: historically the drop has
        generally been modest and short-lived in locations where there is
        strong awareness of, and experience with, extreme weather-related
        events (particularly flooding and exposure to hurricanes/cyclones), but
        there is a small body of recent evidence that certain events can lead
        to a long-lasting decline in prices or liquidity in geographies that
        have heretofore been relatively unexposed to extreme weather or climate
        events, or where intensity and frequency have appreciably increased.

      - Trading volumes or time on market may provide early signals of how
        markets are reacting to climate events and risks through lower
        liquidity that could ultimately feed into prices.

      - Commercial owners/investors in some geographies are placing a higher
        risk premium on all properties in metro areas affected by climate
        events, regardless of whether their individual properties have been
        directly affected.

      - For areas affected by wildfires, floods and storms, significant
        short-term value drops may, in part at least, be offset by amenity
        value. Further, the very limited number of commercial studies points to
        greater persistence of urban agglomeration benefits offsetting
        perceived climatic risks.

      - Access to information on risks and on mitigation measures is a
        contributing factor in value assessment and pricing. The evidence
        suggests that better information leads to greater awareness, belief
        acceptance and integration of climate impacts on prices achieved.

      Consideration should be made on whether changes to climatic patterns occur - 
      for instance we are already experiencing the slowing down of jet streams that 
      lead to previously short-lived extreme events now prolonging (e.g. the polar 
      freeze in Texas in 2021 or flooding in western Europe). This could also extend 
      to previously regions of stable weather / climatic systems experiencing new 
      extreme weather events. Valuation practices, which are largely driven by lagging 
      indicators, suffer from a paucity of climate risk-related evidence and available 
      data. For further detail see:

  Opportunities could present themselves in transition to support commercial 
  real estate as buildings need to provide more carbon and energy efficient 
  services. This could encompass new builds and more importantly retrofits. 
  Growth in real estate is expected to be particularly prevalent in Asia to 
  2050.
