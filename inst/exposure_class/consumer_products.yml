  The **consumer products** sector consists of establishments engaged in retail
  trade; selling commodities for personal or household consumption and rendering
  services incidental to the sale of the goods. Characteristics of retail trade
  establishments generally, but not exclusively, include:

  - a place of business engaged in activities to attract the general public to
    purchase goods, such as:

    - physical store: shops, department stores, fuel stations, salons,
      opticians, consumer cooperatives, auction houses

    - non-physical store: stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales, vending
      machines

  - buying or receiving merchandise as well as selling

  - incidental or secondary processing of its products (not akin to
    manufacturing)

  - being considered as retail in trade terms

  - selling to customers for personal or household use

  - operating warehouses which act as an auxiliary to the core business of the
    customer facing retail stores

  Buying of goods for resale to the consumer is a characteristic of retail trade
  establishments that distinguishes them from agricultural and extractive
  industries, e.g. farmers who sell only their own produce from the point of
  production are not classified as Retail Trade.

  Whilst establishments in the consumer products sector sell to the general
  public for personal or household consumption, there are notable exceptions
  where wholesale trade to businesses are combined, such as timber and
  decorating (DIY), stationery, and fuel supplies. Such outlets are classified
  as Retail Trade even where wholesale supplies predominate.

  Conversely, establishments selling merchandise such as plumbing equipment,
  electrical supplies, used automobile parts, and office furniture are
  classified in Wholesale Trade, even if a higher proportion of their sales is
  made to the general public.

  Additionally, buying of goods for resale to the consumer is a characteristic
  of retail trade establishments that distinguishes them from agricultural and
  extractive industries, e.g. farmers who sell only their own produce from the
  point of production are not classified as Retail Trade.

  Warehouses may be considered as part of the retail establishment where they
  act as an auxiliary to the core business of the customer facing retail stores.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the consumer products 
      sector will need to deliver longer-term carbon reduction initiatives by shifting 
      to lower carbon intensive supplies, reducing the carbon intensity of their 
      physical stores or sales platforms, and using clean energy sources.
    always: |
      As the consumer products sector sits between the manufacturing sector and
      end-consumers, it is subject to the considerations of both the products it
      purchases (or receives) as suppliers react to a top-down policy
      environment that results in a rapid reduction of emissions, as well as the
      changes in customer behaviour as demand shifts towards a low carbon
      economy mindset. In addition, there are considerations to be given to the
      carbon intensity of its own inherent practices, for example distribution,
      property, product choices, utility consumption, or packaging.

      Transition risk arises in the consumer products sector when any of these
      inherent practices must change because of supply line pressures, strategic
      business choices, consumer demand, or regulatory or political pressure (a
      recent example being the banning use of single-use plastics such as
      disposable drinking straws in the UK).

      While the consumer products sector could continue to play a role in
      meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in
      energy generation in the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late
      policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of the economic
      crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon
      prices are increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the
      Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both these scenarios are likely to have a
      significant impact on the inherent practices of retail companies, upstream
      manufacturers and consumer demand, which could affect profitability of
      individual retail companies and the sector overall.
    high_materiality: |
      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the following risks and margin compression may 
      crystallise:

      - **Increased fixed costs** due to higher product purchase costs resulting
        from decarbonisation in the supply chain, especially on imports (c.f. EU
        Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism), or from commercial real estate
        financing costs being higher on less energy efficient properties as
        lenders seek to green their portfolios in line with zero-carbon lending
        strategies. Margins may be maintained by passing these costs through to
        the consumer, but larger retailers may be able to avoid this, and so
        competitiveness becomes an issue.

      - **Higher capital investment costs** through investment in electric
        distribution fleets or new energy efficient lighting, refrigeration, air
        conditioning and heating systems. Margins may be maintained by passing
        these costs through to the consumer, but larger retailers may be able to
        avoid this, and so competitiveness becomes an issue.

      - **Disposal costs/capital write-downs** can be incurred as stranded less
        energy efficient infrastructure needs to be replaced, such as the
        distribution fleets, lighting, air conditioning and heating systems
        above. Such one-off impacts would be hard to mitigate, again costs could
        be passed through to the ultimate consumer.

      - **Higher variable costs**: resulting from more expensive environmentally
        friendly packaging solutions (moving away from single use and
        high-carbon intensive products), change of product lines (to accommodate more 
        environmentally friendly consumer preferences), new advertising of new product lines, 
        and higher energy tariffs resulting from higher carbon prices on fossil fuels and/or a 
        switch to potentially more expensive renewable energy supplies. Such costs could be managed 
        by slow phasing-in of these initiatives, or by passing the costs through.

      - **Lower revenues**: if retailers fail to adapt to consumer-side demand
        for lower carbon intensive products (for example, the recent increased
        demand for vegan foods in the UK) then this may result in erosion of
        their climate conscious customer base. By implementing the previous
        climate impact reducing measures ahead of competitors, this could become
        an opportunity.

      - **Governance and litigation costs**. For larger players in the consumer
        products sector there is an increasing focus on disclosure, from both a
        political and end-user perspective. With homogenisation of taxonomies,
        the comparability and accountability of disclosures could increase, with
        which comes reputational and litigation risk. Litigation costs may arise
        through having to have third-party assessments and assurance of
        environmental disclosures, and as a result of "greenwashing". By
        following industry norms and being a market follower rather than leader
        in this space, this risk could be reduced.

      Furthermore, there is likely to be significant wide economic disruption
      that could lead to falls in equity prices and reduced customer spending
      levels. In these scenarios, the consumer products sector will need to deliver
      longer-term carbon reduction initiatives by shifting to lower carbon
      intensive supplies, reducing the carbon intensity of their physical stores
      or sales platforms, and using clean energy sources. The drive for change
      arises through retailers being sandwiched between a combination of shift
      in end-consumer preferences from the buy side and a similar shift on the
      sell side as manufacturers and suppliers react to a top-down policy
      environment that results in a rapid reduction of emissions. For example, 
      in these scenarios, on the supply side, emissions due to energy consumption 
      from industry (incl. manufacturing) fall from ~8,400 megatons of CO<sub>2</sub>
      per year to between 600 and 1,600 megatons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.

      This could lead to a sudden limited-to-zero supply of carbon intensive goods, 
      which could mean retailers that specialise in such markets in a monoline, or 
      concentrated strategy may find their business models no longer viable (for example,
      fossil fuel suppliers such as petrol stations, and coal and oil
      merchants). On the demand side, a change in consumer sentiment is already
      reflected in a 2020 collaborative retail customer survey led by Globe
      Scan, 74% of 27 000 polled indicated that they wanted to significantly
      reduce their impact on the environment and nature.

      By its very nature, the consumer sector is diverse and nuanced, with
      multiple product categories, distribution platforms and business sizes and
      complexity. Businesses could need to adopt different strategies according
      to these dynamics and the corresponding transition risks and opportunities
      arising from adaptation could differ widely across the sector. In
      overcoming these challenges and considerations, retailers have
      opportunities to position themselves to have both greater appeal to the
      climate conscious consumer and play an integral part in a full end-to-end
      supply-chain of product level carbon intensity analysis.

      In high physical risk scenarios, whilst the consumer products sector is used 
      to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, climate change and 
      global warming could increase weather variations. This could lead to increasing 
      disruption to supply chains and own operations which could impact the profitability 
      for these companies.
    always: |
      The consumer products sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of
      climate change including both the chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels
      and global mean temperatures) and acute effects due to changes in the
      frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,
      wildfires, cyclones and flooding. Whilst the consumer products
      sector is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions,
      in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming
      could increase weather variations. This could lead to increasing
      disruption to supply chains and own operations which could impact the
      profitability for these companies.

      In a high physical risk scenario, small perturbations in climate can lead
      to significant disruption in crop yields and corresponding disruption to
      food supply chains. Even in a 1.5&deg;C warming scenario, flash flooding and
      extreme weather events can pose problems for manufacturers exposed to such
      geographies, leading to supply chain issues, and direct impacts for
      retailers based in these locations.

      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the
      scenarios and these vary in line with different temperatures projected for each 
      scenario. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a
      significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for consumer
      products.

    high_materiality: |
      Consideration should be given to the following hazards when considering
      physical risk for retailers:

      - **Distribution**: disruption to transport infrastructure caused by
        weather events or flooding, leading to inability to fulfil customer
        orders and deliveries, or move stock from warehouses to outlets

      - **Store closures**: occurring through direct impacts such as flooding,
        or through staff inability to get to the location due to transport
        disruption, or due to power outages

      - **Stock losses**: arising through flooding or weather events damaging
        warehouses or retail outlets

      - **Product shortages**: supply chain issues can lead to inability to
        stock products, particularly posing issues for retailers with low
        diversified product offerings

      - **Reduced footfall**: driven by migration away from areas where
        inhabitation is impacted (for example, water level rises in the Somerset
        Levels and the Fens)

      - **Increased costs**: driven by adaptation to new climatic conditions,
        and increased insurance costs (or risk of being uninsurable).

      These hazards could each lead to reductions in revenue and to direct
      losses. Conversely, there may be opportunities to increase sales of items
      that help consumers mitigate against weather events and flooding
      (sandbags, barriers), or assist adaptation to new weather norms (such as
      rainwear) or extended seasonal product periods (beachwear). The following
      examples help to map the potential impacts above and illustrate how the
      Consumer Products sector could be impacted in a high physical risk
      scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**

      - **Rising sea levels** could cause local and permanent disruption to
        distribution networks, store location choices, consumer geographical
        migration and insurance issues. Reduced footfall could also result from
        migration away from affected areas, this was seen following Hurricane
        Katrina in April 2000, where population levels of New Orleans were at
        50% six years after the flood and remained 20% lower 15 years later.

      - **Higher average temperatures**. Even small perturbations in climate can
        lead to significant disruption in crop yields and corresponding
        disruption to food supply chains.

      **Acute Impacts**

      - **Cyclones or storms** could result in disruption of the distribution
        network, stock losses through direct damage, product shortages due to
        disruption of the supply chain (particularly posing issues for retailers
        with low diversified product offerings), reduced footfall due to
        consumers being unable to access shopping locations and due to internet
        outages, and insurance ineligibility. Store closures could also result
        from direct damage to the store, inability of staff to get to the
        location due to transport disruption, or power outages.

      - **Flooding events** could also lead to the same disruption as cyclones
        and storms. Flash flooding can pose problems for manufacturers exposed
        to such geographies, leading to supply chain issues, and direct impacts
        for retailers based in these locations. For example, severe flooding in
        Thailand in 2011 lead to severe supply chain disruption.

      **Source:**
      [BSR Climate and Supply Chain Management](https://www.bsr.org/reports/BSR_Climate_and_Supply_Chain_Management.pdf)

      - **Drought** could lead to competition for water resources as well as
        increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting water supply
        and quality. A lesser impact of this would be to increase water supply
        costs to the sector, but this could be offset through introducing
        product lines to meet consumer demand, such as water storage facilities,
        refrigeration and air conditioning systems.

      There are mitigating actions that retailers could consider against high
      physical risks. For example, relocation of warehousing and stores to less
      flood prone locations, and pre-empting product line changes as the
      climatic changes take hold. Another consideration would be to explore
      options of more flexible store locations, such as pop-up shops.

      Understanding the impact on the supply chain, particularly the
      manufacturing sector, could lead to a decision to diversify supplier
      networks. This could be particularly focused on choosing more local
      suppliers so that widespread international distribution disruption would
      have a less significant effect than it would if reliance on imported goods
      was retained. This would be particularly pertinent for food supplies.
      Customer engagement would be crucial to develop a supply-led trend for
      less wide-ranging product choices in such a scenario (undoing the fashion
      for greater choice that has grown via the Great Acceleration that has
      proliferated since the second world war).

      - **Drought** could lead to competition for water resources as well as
        increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting water supply
        and quality. A lesser impact of this would be to increase water supply
        costs to the sector, but this could be offset through introducing
        product lines to meet consumer demand, such as water storage facilities,
        refrigeration and air conditioning systems.

      There are mitigating actions that retailers could consider against such
      low physical risks. For example, relocation of warehousing and stores to
      less flood prone locations, and pre-empting product line changes as the
      climatic changes take hold. Another consideration would be to explore
      options of more flexible store locations, such as pop-up shops.

      Understanding the impact on the supply chain, particularly the
      manufacturing sector, could lead to a decision to diversify supplier
      networks. This could be particularly focused on choosing more local
      suppliers so that widespread international distribution disruption would
      have a less significant effect than it would if reliance on imported goods
      was retained. This would be particularly pertinent for food supplies.
      Customer engagement would be crucial to develop a supply-led trend for
      less wide-ranging product choices in such a scenario (undoing the fashion
      for greater choice that has grown via the Great Acceleration that has
      proliferated since the second world war).

  **Rising temperatures and retail sales**
  
  It is established that retail sales are negatively impacted by negative 
  divergence of seasonal temperatures from the norm, and positively impacted 
  by positive divergence of seasonal temperatures from the norm:
