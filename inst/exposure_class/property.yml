name: Property Underwriting Class
test_report_position: 19
description: | 
  The **property** underwriting class covers a very wide range of asset types
  and coverages, with risk transfers flowing from the policyholders, through to
  insurers, reinsurers and retrocessional reinsurers, and with both simple (e.g.
  direct) and complex risk sharing arrangements between multiple parties, for
  example through bordereau and other aggregate risk products.

  Underwriting is the act of accepting liability up to a specified amount in an
  insurance policy, and generally, property insurance could be related to either
  fixed, immovable assets such as buildings or movable property, such as
  transport or goods in transit, in both personal (e.g. residential/domestic)
  and professional (e.g. landlords, commercial real estate, industrial real
  estate) settings.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the increase in carbon price 
      along with a change to the demand in the quality of real estate are likely 
      to influence insurance products' pricing, terms and conditions and coverage. 
      There is likely to be an increasing pressure on insurers to decline cover for 
      high GHG emitting industrial or commercial activities.
    always: |
      While the property underwriting class could continue to play a role in
      meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in
      energy generation, in the Delayed transition scenario, driven by late
      policy action enabling a "fossil recovery" out of the economic
      crisis brought about by COVID-19, results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon
      prices are increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. In the
      Divergent scenario there is a more immediate but divergent reduction in
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In both these scenarios, the increase in carbon
      price, along with a change to the demand in the quality of real estate
      (e.g. emissions from the construction and fabric of the building, energy
      efficiency performance and use of low carbon technology (especially
      heating and cooling)), is likely to influence property insurance products'
      pricing, terms and conditions and coverage.

      Under most transition scenarios, there is likely to be an increasing
      pressure on insurers to decline cover for high GHG emitting industrial or
      commercial activities, which in turn could influence the overall
      underwriting strategy employed within non-life property insurers. National
      and international legislative actions, for example in determining premium
      rates or coverage limitations, influenced by transition policies, may also
      affect future underwriting strategies but to an uncertain level.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and
      energy mix could potentially result in one or more of the following
      impacts on the property underwriting class:

      - **Changes in underwriting rules** regarding excluded or stranded asset
        types, including fossil fuel or other carbon intensive industrial or
        commercial activities and assets.

      - **Changes to the demand** for insurance products due to changes in
        consumer behaviour or national or international policy changes regarding
        transition rules and expectations.

      - **Increased regulatory oversight and sanctions** for non-compliant
        insurance companies. There is also potential legal or other liability
        risks, and associated reputational risks, due to inadequate transition
        strategies.

      - **Inability to secure reinsurance coverage** (either availability of
        capital, or exclusions) for insured risks which are not in line with
        industry Net Zero commitments.

      - **Opportunities arising from the development of new classes of assets
        and risk transfer requirements**, e.g., through technological and social
        changes influencing product design and insurance capacity.

      The specific nature of the climate related transition risks and
      opportunities could vary widely. The underwriting processes followed could
      be designed to reflect the particular needs of each property class, for
      example, domestic household versus commercial real estate or industrial
      insurance. The level of exposure by property sector could therefore vary
      significantly. In general terms, a differentiation between
      residential/domestic and commercial/industrial property can be made to
      illustrate potential consideration with respect to transition risks from
      climate change.

      Contractual terms, including exclusions (e.g. insurance 'wordings'), play
      an important role in determining the level of cover, and hence exposure
      either retained by the policyholder, or ceded to insurers and reinsurers.
      This could also vary widely depending on the type of assets being insured,
      the territorial coverage of the assets and the insurance policy in place.
      Transition risks can influence contractual policy wordings both through a
      company's risk appetite, but also through market standards which can
      themselves be influenced by transition risk considerations. The
      uncertainty which surrounds the likely rate and direction of the
      transition to Net Zero, alongside the evolving regulatory, consumer and
      technological environments which influence insurance product design and
      risk assessments, mean that the ability to determine likely materiality
      from transition risk, could be limited by the availability of information
      that adequately reflects the range of possible outcomes over the near and
      longer timescales.

      The geographic extents and territorial coverage of insured assets, as well
      as the domicile of the insurer, by determining the legislative and
      supervisory environment which it is operating within, could also influence
      the materiality of transition risks and hence underwriting impact.

      The profitability of the property underwriting class could also depend on
      the relevant companies proactively addressing transition risks through
      mitigating actions. For example:

      - Developing a clear net-zero underwriting strategy based on industry
        standards such as the Net Zero Insurance Alliance
        (https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-insurance/){target="\_blank"}.

      - Applying a range of scenarios reflecting the most likely range of
        socio-economic, legislative technological and consumer futures within
        the risk appetite, and underwriting strategies applied across all
        property lines of business, especially in the likely influences on
        changing portfolio structure, and diversification options.

      - Ensuring underwriting rules and policies are aligned to corporate and
        industry wide Net Zero objectives.

      - Encouraging policy holder's approaches to risk mitigation and transition
        strategies through increased knowledge transfer and remediation
        advisories, as well as new product development, for example to support
        Orderly transition to agreed timescales for high GHG emitting assets and
        activities.

      The underwriting function within most insurers and reinsurers could need
      to consider a wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of
      insurance (e.g., setting the technical rate and premium required based on
      estimated loss potential) and the management of the insurer or reinsurer's
      aggregate exposure to losses (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims
      occurring due to a natural disaster). The specific underwriting process
      followed, and the considerations made by an insurer or reinsurer, for
      example when determining underwriting authorities across the business,
      could depend on the risk appetite and portfolio exposure management
      strategy in place.

      Commercial underwriting decisions related to price and capacity could be
      influenced by transition risk considerations, as these could either
      directly affect the selection and acceptance of risk (through the
      inclusion of conditions such as exclusions or retention in a specific
      policy) or influence aggregate limits and share and line sizes, as well as
      directly affect the premium rate set, whether technically and
      risk-aligned, or due to market, regulatory or consumer demand drivers. In
      addition, rating and shareholder drivers could also influence insurance
      underwriting decisions, either in determining limits on the level of risk
      acceptance, or in the setting of corporate risk appetite and capital.

physical:
  high:
    exec_description: |
      In high physical risk scenarios, insurance underwriting strategies could 
      need to assess existing, and future physical risks, not only due to the 
      potential for future changes in the physical drivers of climate related 
      hazards (e.g., flood intensity, frequency and extents), but also due to 
      changes in the distribution of exposures and in the types of assets being insured.
    always: |
      While the non-life property insurance market is generally highly exposed
      to physical risks, and in particular from those related to weather
      extremes the actual materiality of an insurer's portfolio and the policies
      it writes could however vary significantly, by geography, asset class and
      risk mitigation strategies in place. As most traditional property
      insurance policies could be short term, for one year, this has limited the
      level of concern applied to changing physical risks from climate change.
      However, this does not take account of the already significant changes in
      potential severity, frequency, and aggregation of extreme loss causing
      events at the global and regional scales which the property insurance
      sector is already experiencing.

      This means that any insurance underwriting strategy could need to assess
      existing, and future, physical risk, not only due to the potential for
      future changes in the physical drivers of climate related hazards (e.g.,
      flood intensity, frequency and extents), but also due to changes in the
      distribution of exposures due to changing underwriting plans, and changes
      in the types of assets being insured.

    high_materiality: |
      The relative materiality of physical risks to insurers and hence the
      impact on underwriting strategies, could vary over time, and at varying
      rates. The interdependency which exists between hazard, exposure and
      vulnerability elements of insured property assets could also influence the
      level of materiality experienced across a portfolio, and this could also
      vary over time.

      In particular the following physical risk considerations are likely to be
      relevant to underwriting strategies:

      - **Changing exposure accumulations at portfolio levels** resulting from
        the changes to the underwriting strategies and risk appetites of the
        insurer.

      - **Unaffordability of insurance** due to increased technical rates and
        premiums, especially due to the addition of increased uncertainty within
        pricing models.

      - **Increased risk of underinsurance and reinsurance failure** due to
        underestimation of potential losses, particularly aggregate loss from
        multiple occurring extremes.

      - **Changes to the level of portfolio diversification** achieved across an
        insurance property book due to varying hazard, exposure and
        vulnerability from climate related influences, especially due to higher
        frequencies of multiple loss causing events from the range of climate
        related impacts to properties, whether via direct physical damage or
        indirect impacts to supply chains or other factors critical to the
        performance of the insured assets.

      - **Increased cost of capital** due to increased uncertainty amongst
        reinsurance and other capital providers.

      - **Opportunities for new products or lines of business** reflecting
        changing patterns of hazard and demand for insurance cover, e.g., for
        climate related business interruption policies.

      The specific nature of these risks could vary widely. The underwriting
      processes followed could be designed to reflect the particular needs of
      each property class, for example, domestic household versus commercial
      real estate or industrial insurance. The level of exposure by property
      sector could therefore vary significantly. In general terms, a
      differentiation between residential/domestic and commercial/industrial
      property can be made to illustrate potential consideration with respect to
      physical risks from climate change.

      Contractual terms, including exclusions (e.g. insurance 'wordings'), play
      an important role in determining the level of cover, and hence exposure
      either retained by the policyholder, or ceded to insurers and reinsurers.
      This could also vary widely depending on the type of assets being insured
      and the territorial coverage of the assets. Physical risks can influence
      contractual policy wordings both through a company's risk appetite, but
      also through market standards which can themselves be influenced by
      physical risk considerations.

      Underwriting decisions on price, through either experience based pricing,
      or actuarial / model based, require considerable understanding of the
      potential range of losses which could impact both individual assets and
      policy holders, but equally the aggregate risk which the insurer is
      exposed to across all policies and lines of business which it provides.

      The increased uncertainties, which underly the assessment of changing
      physical risks, mean that utilising frequency and severity distribution
      methods for pricing and portfolio assessment could be less effective as a
      means to effectively account for future losses within premiums. The lack
      of consistent modelling approaches for both present day and future
      physical risk, particularly in emerging economies and markets,
      means that there could be a lower level of confidence placed on estimates
      of probable maximum loss. This uncertainty drives many of the physical
      risk considerations mentioned.

      The profitability of the property underwriting class could also depend on
      the relevant companies proactively addressing physical risks through
      mitigating actions. For example:

      - Developing improved data capture and modelling processes that more
        accurately represent the levels of vulnerability and resilience of
        insured assets to direct and indirect physical risks - both present day
        and future.

      - Encouraging improved resiliency amongst policyholders through advisory
        services and risk reduction initiatives. Resilience could also be
        encouraged on a larger scale through influencing public policy
        engagement on flood defences, building regulations, local/civic planning
        strategy, infrastructure roadmaps and projects.

      - Incorporating a forward-looking element into risk modelling and pricing
        tools

      - Developing a range of realistic scenarios which reflect a range of
        potential future impacts on physical risk at various short, medium and
        long-time horizons.

      - Developing policies and products which are aligned to changing consumer
        requirements, and physical risk profiles.

      - Ensuring risk appetite and tolerance statements, and associated
        underwriting authorities are fully aligned to clear physical risk scenarios

      The underwriting function within most insurers and reinsurers could need
      to consider a wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of
      insurance (e.g., setting the technical rate and premium required based on
      estimated loss potential) and the management of the insurer or reinsurer's
      aggregate exposure to losses (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims

      influence aggregate limits and share and line sizes, as well as directly
      affect the premium rate set, whether technically and risk-aligned, or due
      to market, regulatory or consumer demand drivers. In addition, rating and
      shareholder drivers could also influence insurance underwriting decisions,
      either in determining limits on the level of risk acceptance, or in the
      setting of corporate risk appetite and capital.

      - **Changes to the level of portfolio diversification** achieved across an

        related impacts to properties, whether via direct physical damage or
        indirect impacts to supply chains or other factors critical to the
        performance of the insured assets.

      - **Increased cost of capital** due to increased uncertainty amongst
        reinsurance and other capital providers.

      - **Opportunities for new products or lines of business** reflecting
        changing patterns of hazard and demand for insurance cover, e.g., for

        services and risk reduction initiatives. Resilience could also be
        encouraged on a larger scale through influencing public policy
        engagement on flood defences, building regulations, local/civic planning
        strategy, infrastructure roadmaps and projects.

      - Incorporating a forward-looking element into risk modelling and pricing
        tools

      - Developing a range of realistic scenarios which reflect a range of
        potential future impacts on physical risk at various short, medium and
        long-time horizons.

      - Developing policies and products which are aligned to changing consumer
        requirements, and physical risk profiles.

      - Ensuring risk appetite and tolerance statements, and associated
        underwriting authorities are fully aligned to clear physical risk scenarios.

      The underwriting function within most insurers and reinsurers could need
      to consider a wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of
      insurance (e.g., setting the technical rate and premium required based on
      estimated loss potential) and the management of the insurer or reinsurer's
      aggregate exposure to losses (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims
      occurring due to a natural disaster). The specific underwriting process
      followed, and the considerations made by an insurer or reinsurer, for
      example when determining underwriting authorities across the business,
      could depend on the risk appetite and portfolio exposure management
      strategy in place.

      Commercial underwriting decisions related to price and capacity could be
      influenced by physical risk considerations, as these could either directly
      affect the selection and acceptance of risk (through the inclusion of
      conditions such as exclusions or retention in a specific policy) or
      influence aggregate limits and share and line sizes, as well as directly
      affect the premium rate set, whether technically and risk-aligned, or due
      to market, regulatory or consumer demand drivers. In addition, rating and
      shareholder drivers could also influence insurance underwriting decisions,
      either in determining limits on the level of risk acceptance, or in the
      setting of corporate risk appetite and capital.
