  Sovereign (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to 
  support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the 
  bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of coupon 
  payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. The government bond sector is 
  a broad category that includes "sovereign" debt, which is issued and generally 
  backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, German Bunds, Japanese 
  Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and Government of Canada 
  Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government bonds. The US, Japan and 
  Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in the government bond market.
  
  Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation, 
  known as inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected 
  Securities (TIPS). On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal 
  is adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in the rate of inflation, 
  thus providing a "real," or inflation-adjusted, return. But, unlike other bonds, 
  inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when real interest rates 
  are moving faster than nominal interest rates.
  
  In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes subcomponents, 
  such as:
  
  * Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various goals - 
  supporting affordable housing or the development of small businesses, for example - 
  through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to support their operations. 
  Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central government while others are not. 
  Supranational organisations, like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, 
  also borrow in the bond market to finance public projects and/or development.
  
  * Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or cities - 
  borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools, as well as 
  general operations. The market for local government bonds is well established in 
  the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other developed markets 
  also issue provincial/local government bonds.
  
  In this paper we refer to a '20-notch' sovereign bond rating scale translated from S&P's alphabetical 
  standardized rating scale (see Appendix), which is used to outline changes to sovereign bond 
  ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. Impacts of climate change on 
  sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference to the 2021 working paper titled 
  "Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign 
  Creditworthiness" from the University of Cambridge. This study represents one approach 
  towards quantifying the effects of climate change on credit ratings and is illustrative 
  based on a hypothetical model. It is not predictive and broader literature on this 
  topic is also available.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, delayed or divergent policy reaction, 
      societal change and national energy strategies could lead to significant 
      increases in carbon prices. This could have an impact on sovereign bonds in 
      particular in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.
    always: |
      In the Delayed transition risk scenario, the Delayed transition driven by a 
      late policy action enables a "fossil recovery" out of the economic crisis brought 
      about by COVID-19. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase until 2030 before policies 
      drive a sharp decrease after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. This 
      results in smaller increases in carbon taxes compared to Orderly transition scenarios 
      until 2030, but significantly higher carbon taxes thereafter as countries attempt to make 
      up lost ground. In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> 
      emissions starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.
      
      These scenarios could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in 
      countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. 
      Industries that are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as mining, 
      oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel demand and 
      increased costs from significantly higher carbon taxes. Countries with high 
      energy intensity or high fossil-fuel extraction include Estonia, Bulgaria, 
      Czechia, Greece and Poland. Countries with low energy intensity, such as 
      Austria, Finland, France, Spain and Sweden are less vulnerable to transition risk.
      
      On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) 
      could encourage consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, 
      energy efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading to increases in fiscal revenues. 
      The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP 
      growth. This would have a negative impact on EU sovereign bonds.

      **Carbon tax effect**
      
      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to
      carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive 
      sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to 
      transition risk. 

      The impact from Disorderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal 
      revenues are largely dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying 
      to mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more 
      environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns 
      can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed transition 
      policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the respective 
      country's size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, such 
      as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms' profitability, 
      which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
      [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf){target="\_blank"}).
      
      The EU's emissions have decreased in recent years, with an accelerating trend
      since 2017. In 2021, an additional 26 GW of solar PV and 11 GW of wind capacity was 
      installed. Generation from renewables in absolute terms amounted to 1,030 TWh (Tera-Watt hour), 
      which was a 90 TWh increase from 2020.
      
      A large number of EU member states have either had no coal generation in their electricity mix 
      or adopted a coal phase out by 2030. However, high fossil gas prices and an increase in electricity 
      consumption resulted in a growth of coal-based electricity generation from 364 TWh (Terawatt-hour) 
      in 2020 to 436 TWh in the second half of 2021. 
      
      The share of renewables in the EU's electricity generation reached 39% in 2020. In 2021, the share of 
      coal in electricity generation increased from 13% to 15%.  Fossil gas covered 18% of EU's electricity 
      generation in 2021.

      In July 2021, the European Commission presented its "Fit for 55" package of policy proposals to achieve a
      reduction of EU emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The package also includes proposals 
      for a higher share of renewables in the overall energy mix (40% by 2030) and increased energy efficiency. 
      The REPowerEU plan, put forward in May 2022, proposes to increase the share of renewables in final energy by 2030 
      from 40% to 45%. Policies implemented to date would only result in emissions reductions between 36-47%. This difference
      is the result of national policies lagging behind policies adopted at the EU level.

      In response to the ongoing energy crisis, the EU and its member states have been signing agreements for scaling up
      fossil gas imports from around the world and have been making new investments in fossil gas infrastructure, especially 
      new liquid natural gas import terminals and gas pipelines. Such investment will only shift energy dependency from Russia 
      to other countries, and result in carbon lock-in contrary to the EU's emissions reduction goals.

      **GDP growth effect**
      
      A change in a country's GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it receives. Assuming
      taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According 
      to estimates from the NGFS, Disorderly transition risk scenario could result in significant GDP losses.
      In these scenarios, world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated to be between
      -4.6% and -4.7% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP impacts from 
      transition risk are negative as the speed of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and affects 
      consumption and investment. In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and transition risks in 2050. 
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Disorderly scenario
      on EU GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects,  would be significant, ranging from -2.9% to -3.4% (relative 
      to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.
      
      **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
      
      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond
      market. No sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related 
      risks it faces, although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends 
      could have implications for ratings in coming decades. According to 
      the 2021 "Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate 
      Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness" working paper from the University of 
      Cambridge, in Disorderly transition risk scenarios, most EU countries 
      would be marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would 
      be among top-rated countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased 
      climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity 
      of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. 
      
      According to the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, Germany would have a downgrade 
      below one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the German 
      government by approximately US$0.23-0.35bn. France would have a downgrade 
      below one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the French 
      government by approximately US$1.35-2.02bn.

      In Orderly transition risk scenarios, immediate policy reaction, 
      societal change and national energy strategies leads to significant and 
      immediate increases in carbon prices. This could have a strong impact 
      on fiscal revenues in countries with a strong level of dependence on

      transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues 
      from lower fossil fuel demand and increased costs from higher carbon taxes. 
      
      Countries with high energy intensity or high fossil-fuel extraction include 
      Estonia, Bulgaria, Czechia, Greece and Poland. Countries with low energy 
      intensity, such as Austria, Finland, France, Spain and Sweden are less 
      vulnerable to transition risk. 
      
      On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) 
      could encourage consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, 
      energy efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading to increases in fiscal 
      revenues. These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction 
      in GDP growth or even a limited increase in GDP growth. This would have a 
      limited, neutral impact on EU sovereign bonds.

      **Carbon tax effect**
      
      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure 
      to carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Based on the IIASA NGFS 
      Climate Scenarios, REMIND model by 2050, in Orderly 
      scenarios, fossil fuels represent only ~25% to ~40% of global energy demand compared 
      to ~85% in 2020. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas 
      are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk. 
      
      The impact of Orderly transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues 
      is largely dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to 
      mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more 
      environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns 
      can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed 
      transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on 
      the respective country's size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, 
      green policies, such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, 
      firms' profitability, which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues 
      (for more detail see

      risks) by 2050. GDP impacts from transition risk are moderately negative in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative
      impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are only partially offset by the recycling of carbon
      revenues into government investment and lower employment taxes.

      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs) , the expected impact of an Orderly transition
      risk scenario on EU GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects,  would be significant, ranging from -1.6% to

      In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth 
      due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower 
      productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and 
      acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or higher insurance premiums. 
      This would result in a material negative impact on GDP globally by 2100 and 
      hit governments' finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, 
      and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, 
      cities and states. There are also likely indirect risks, such as those caused 
      by international migration (e.g. increased inequalities, labour right issues, 
      social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries' supply chains and 
      international trade. The high physical risk scenario could lead to a significant 
      reduction in GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on EU sovereign bonds.
      
      As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of 
      climate change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and 
      water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of human migration. 
      Climate migration could lead to increasing political instability. With people 
      in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this may cause 
      conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change 
      could lead to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. 
      As a result, political instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both 
      within and between countries.

      **GDP growth effect**
      
      In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures could increase
      across the world by 2.4&deg;C to 3&deg;C compared to pre-industrial levels 
      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher 
      warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions 
      affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level 
      rise, which will consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. It can also 
      change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,
      wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
      
      Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect 
      of increasing temperature on economic output, with productivity peaking at 
      an annual average temperature of 13&deg;C and declining strongly at higher 
      temperatures. In a high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, unmitigated warming is 
      expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes by 
      roughly 23% by 2100, relative to scenarios without climate change. 
      
      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues 
      are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal 
      expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a 
      reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, a hot house world scenario
      with high physical risk could result in significant GDP losses. In a hot house world scenario,
      world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated to be between -5.7% and-6% 
      (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP losses from physical
      risks vary in line with different temperatures projected for each scenario. Based on the IIASA NGFS 
      Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a hot house world scenario on EU GDP,
      from chronic physical and transition effects,  would be significant, ranging from -3.3% to -3.4% (relative
      to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

      scenario, most developed countries would be significantly downgraded, 
      with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100. Most downgrades would

      climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the 
      top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating.
      
      According to the study, in a high physical risk scenario, Germany would have 
      a downgrade exceeding three notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for 
      the German government by approximately US$3.7-5.5bn. France would have a 
      downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for 
      the French government by approximately US$3.9-5.9bn.

      the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts,

      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces, 
      although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends will have 
      implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 "Rising 
      Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign 
      Creditworthiness" working paper from the University of Cambridge, in a 
      low physical risk (NGFS Orderly) scenario, most developed countries would 
      be marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among 
      top-rated countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks 
      for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. 
      It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. According to the study, 
      in a low physical risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, Germany would have a downgrade  
      below one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the German 
      government by approximately US$0.23-0.35bn. France would have a downgrade  
      below one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the French 
      government by approximately US$1.35-2.02bn.
