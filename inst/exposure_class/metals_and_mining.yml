  In the present document, it is admitted that companies in the **mining** 
  sector (except Oil and Gas) primarily engage in mining, mine site development, 
  and beneficiating (i.e. preparing - crushing, screening, washing, sizing, 
  concentrating, and flotation) metallic minerals and non-metallic minerals, 
  including coal. The term "mining" is used in the broad sense to include ore 
  extraction, quarrying, and beneficiating, customarily done at the mine site.

  The mining sector includes companies that have complete responsibility for
  operating mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) and those that operate
  mines and quarries (except oil and gas wells) for others on a contract or fee
  basis. Also included are companies engaged in providing support activities
  (except site preparation and related construction activities) on a contract or
  fee basis for the mining and quarrying of metallic minerals and for the
  extraction of metal ores. Exploration for these minerals is also included in
  this industry. Exploration (except geophysical surveying and mapping services)
  includes traditional prospecting methods, such as taking core samples and
  making geological observations at prospective sites.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the changing patterns in 
      energy consumption will have a negative impact on carbon-intensive sectors 
      such as coal mining, however this contraction in demand could be offset by 
      the need to increase mining of other minerals vital to clean energy technologies.
    always: |
      By 2050, in Disorderly transition risk scenarios, coal represents 1%
      (in the Delayed Transition scenario) or 0.6% (in the Divergent Net Zero
      scenario) of global energy demand, compared to 30% in 2020.
      Carbon-intensive sectors such as coal mining are consequently some of the
      most vulnerable to transition.

      Coal mining is a special case among its sectoral peers, the changing
      patterns in energy consumption, driven by societal change, national energy
      strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and
      long-term impact on demand for coal, or even lead to its total abandon,
      with no need for new coal mines or extensions of existing ones. The mining
      of minerals needed for clean energy transitions (e.g. copper, lithium and
      nickel) could increases very rapidly, and mining expertise is likely to be
      highly valued in this context.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy prices could
      potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - **Reduced revenue for coal mining companies** due to decline in coal
        demand as consumers switch to low-carbon/electrified alternatives.

      - **Increased revenue for mining companies investing in other metals**
        widely used in the renewable energy and electric vehicles segments.

      - **Increased costs** from paying a price on carbon emissions via tax or
        cap & trade clearing price as well as increase in mine site costs
        (labour, fuel, electricity cost at mine and mill). The increase in
        carbon price could lead to increases in operational costs. For example,
        gold mines in South Africa have the highest GHG intensity per unit of
        ore treated, and this intensity is 23 times higher than gold mines
        located in the US. According to S&P Global, US gold mines could face a
        5% increase in operating costs, whilst South Africa could face a near
        25% increase.

      In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the mining sector is 
      likely to be impacted. Overall, in terms of primary energy demand in the 
      Disorderly transition risk scenarios, demand of coal falls rapidly (after 2030 in 
      both scenarios) and is replaced mostly by renewable energy sources.

      Coal primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) could
      also decrease compared to 2020 levels (more significantly in the Divergent
      scenario compared to the Delayed scenario).

      By 2050, the contraction in coal demand, in Disorderly transition risk
      scenarios, could be offset by the need to increase mining of other raw
      minerals, including those vital to many clean energy technologies. Global
      demand for these critical minerals could rise rapidly. For example,
      lithium (used for batteries), platinum, palladium and other catalyst
      materials (used for hydrogen fuel cells and carbon capture), and rare
      earths (used for wind-turbine magnets), could all see a large increase in
      demand. More energy-efficient processing and widespread recycling, which
      are likely to put pressure on virgin-ore markets. Bauxite, copper, and
      iron ore could see growth from new decarbonization technologies at least
      partly offset by increased recycling rates. Although these critical
      mineral resources are not always located in the same locations or
      countries as existing coal mines, the skills and experience of mining
      companies could be essential to ensure that the supply of these minerals
      is able to match demand at reasonable prices. Many new mining projects
      could have to be developed rapidly and sustainably to fuel the transition,
      which could be challenging from an operating perspective.

      The high physical risk scenarios could lead to increasing disruption to mining 
      production and could affect profitability, however, there is a variation in 
      exposure, depending on the mine's geographical location.
    always: |
      The mining sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of climate
      change including both the chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and
      acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather
      events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and flooding. 
      Extreme weather events could also impact the national and global
      supply of chemicals and other materials needed for a mining site's
      process, plants, and mine equipment and impact the ability to ship
      concentrate to international markets. Whilst the mining sector is used to
      responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high
      physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming could increase
      weather variations. This could lead to increasing disruption to mining
      production which could significantly impact the profitability for these
      companies. Note there is a variation in exposure, depending on the mine's
      geographical location.
    high_materiality: |
      The following examples illustrate how the mining sector could be impacted
      in a high physical risk scenario:

      **Chronic Impacts**: **Water Stress** is the key physical risk faced by 
      the sector; the issue could lead to greater competition between mining 
      companies as they fight for scarce water resources. It could also likely 
      lead to an expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on 
      protecting water supply and quality. This would incur hefty additional 
      costs for water intensive industries such as mining. Around 30% to 50% of 
      copper, gold, iron ore, and zinc productions are already concentrated 
      in 'water stress hot-spots' (central Asia, Chilean coast, eastern 
      Australia, the Middle East, southern Africa, western Australia, and a 
      large zone in western North America). Changes to precipitation patterns 
      could place increasing stress on the availability of water at these sites, as 
      well as at sites not currently under water stress. Depending on the water 
      intensiveness of the industrial process, such changes, while seemingly minor 
      in percentage terms, could be critical to a mine's operations or license to 
      operate.

      **Acute Impacts**: **Flooding** from extreme rains can also cause operational 
      disruptions, including mine closure, washed-out roads, and unsafe water 
      levels in tailing dams. At one open-pit coal mine, McKinsey observed 10% 
      annual production losses from wet weather. Flooding affects iron ore and 
      zinc more than others, based on their location, at 50% and 40% of global
      volume, respectively. McKinsey warns that the problem is expected to get 
      worse, particularly in six "wet spots" likely to experience a 50 to 60% 
      increase in extreme precipitation this century: northern Australia, South 
      America, and southern Africa during Southern Hemisphere summer, and central 
      and western Africa, India and Southeast Asia, and Indonesia during Southern 
      Hemisphere winter. Another big risk faced by mining is uncontrolled wildfires, 
      that tend to multiply across the globe, in regions suffering from drought 
      and heatwaves.

      There are many mitigating actions that companies can take against the high
      physical risks mentioned above. For example, investing in resilient
      solutions e.g. technological solutions and internal performance standards
      to reduce water usage, infrastructure that meets high specifications,
      wildfire risk management programs including prescribed burning operations,
      and working with key suppliers and distributors to determine their
      resilience to extreme weather events and define alternative routes.
