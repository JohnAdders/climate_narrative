  Policies drive a sharp decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 
  and increase of carbon prices until 2030. In the Divergent Net Zero 
  scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to occur 
  earlier and as a result is more gradual, the carbon prices rise at 
  a smoother. The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon are 
  projected to increase (e.g. annual investment in low carbon increases 
  from ~750 billion USD to ~3 trillion USD by 2050). The global mean 
  temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 
  1.8&deg;C compared to pre-industrial levels.
  
  The Delayed/Divergent transition risk scenarios could lead to chronic changes 
  in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity (reduce capacity 
  of the human body to perform physical labour from ~0.035% in 2020 to ~0.09% 
  in 2050), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further 
  change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, 
  wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. The GDP losses are estimated to be 
  between -4.2% and-4.8% by 2050.

  These Delayed/Divergent transition risk scenarios assume the introduction

  The NGFS have provided two disorderly scenarios:

  - **Divergent Net Zero** reaches net zero globally around 2050 but with higher
    costs in the short-term due to divergent policies being adopted across
    sectors leading to inefficiencies and a quicker phase out of oil use.

  - **Delayed transition** assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030.
    Strong policies are needed to limit warming to below 2&deg;C by 2050.
    CO<sub>2</sub> removal is limited.

  ## Key assumptions and parameters

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, which results
  in emissions increasing until 2030. Policies drive a sharp decrease in
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand.
  In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis, which delays the increase of carbon
  prices until 2030, compared to the Divergent Net Zero scenario where carbon
  prices rise at a smoother rate because while there are varied policies
  implemented across countries and sectors these measures have been put in place
  earlier. In both the scenarios disorderly policy action results in transition
  risk.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon are projected to increase 
  in Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios. These are expected to be 
  higher in a Divergent compared to a Delayed scenario. Overall, firms could be 
  required to readjust their capital expenditure in line with these trends; 
  developing more efficient and less carbon intensive products and services in 
  order to adhere to carbon pricing policies. The technologies that result from 
  these investments could also adjust asset valuations of relatively older 
  technology. Annual investment in energy efficiency increases from around 200 
  billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between 600 billion USD 
  and 850 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon increases 
  from ~750 billion USD to ~3 trillion USD by 2050.

  Observed climate change on 1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, has
  already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population
  annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical cyclones, wildfire,
  drought and heatwaves. (See Kaufman, D. et al. (2020)). The increasing 
  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere 
  are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are extremely likely 
  to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. 
  In these scenarios global mean temperatures are projected to increase across 
  the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, with land 
  warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. For example, 
  in the delayed transition risk scenario we could see the following:
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
    body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions worsens 
    from ~0.035% in 2020 to ~0.09% in 2050. However, this decrease lessens after 2050.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, 
    peaking at a ~140% over a  1986-2006 reference period around 2035, and 
    remaining around this level thereafter. Annual economic damages from tropical 
    cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser extent; peaking at 
    ~20% above reference period levels around 2050.

  In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -4.2% and -4.8%
  by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in
  temperatures in the scenarios over time. World GDP impacts from
  Disorderly/Divergent transition risks are negative as the speed of the
  transition combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and
  investment. In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and
  transition risks in 2050.

  The GDP losses highlighted in the below graph were calculated based on 
  Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) methodology at the country level for the
  change in average temperature in each scenario compared to the previous year.
  This methodology does not include impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level
  rise or wider societal impacts from migration or conflict; these would likely 
  strongly increase the physical risk. These estimates also
  do not fully capture adaptation, which would reduce impacts but require
  significant investment.

  Overall, the Delayed transition scenario creates a risk of leaving very little
  or no time to develop and deploy counter measures. This leaves a limited
  timeframe for companies and the population to adapt to these changes. In a
  Divergent Net Zero scenario, it would be difficult to implement consistent and
  agreeable policies across different regions.
