  These Disorderly/Divergent transition risk scenarios assume the introduction
  of effective policy change is delayed or divergent across countries and
  sectors.

  The NGFS have provided two disorderly scenarios:

  - **Divergent Net Zero** reaches net zero globally around 2050 but with higher
    costs in the short-term due to divergent policies being adopted across
    sectors leading to inefficiencies and a quicker phase out of oil use.

  - **Delayed transition** assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030.
    Strong policies are needed to limit warming to below 2&deg;C by 2050.
    CO<sub>2</sub> removal is limited.

  ## Key assumptions and parameters

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, which results
  in emissions increasing until 2030. Policies drive a sharp decrease in
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand.
  In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis, which delays the increase of carbon
  prices until 2030, compared to the Divergent Net Zero scenario where carbon
  prices rise at a smoother rate because while there are varied policies
  implemented across countries and sectors these measures have been put in place
  earlier. In both the scenarios disorderly policy action results in transition
  risk.

  Observed climate change on 1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, has
  already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population
  annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical cyclones, wildfire,
  drought and heatwaves. (See Kaufman, D. et al. (2020)).

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in
  the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are
  extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th
  century. In Disorderly transition risk scenarios global mean temperatures are
  projected to increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C with land warming
  faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding.

  In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -4.2% and -4.8%
  by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in
  temperatures in the scenarios over time. World GDP impacts from
  Disorderly/Divergent transition risks are negative as the speed of the
  transition combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and
  investment. In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and
  transition risks in 2050.

  Note GDP losses highlighted in the above graph were calculated based on the
  methodology set out in Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) at the country level for the
  change in average temperature in each scenario compared to the previous year.
  The methodology does not include impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level
  rise or wider societal impacts from migration or conflict. For given countries
  these would likely strongly increase the physical risk. These estimates also
  do not fully capture adaptation, which would reduce impacts but require
  significant investment.

  Overall, the Delayed transition scenario creates a risk of leaving very little
  or no time to develop and deploy counter measures. This leaves a limited
  timeframe for companies and the population to adapt to these changes. In a
  Divergent Net Zero scenario, it would be difficult to implement consistent and
  agreeable policies across different regions.
