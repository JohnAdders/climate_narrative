  Disorderly transition risk scenarios assume the introduction of effective policy change 
  is delayed or divergent across countries and sectors. In the Delayed transition scenario, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease until 2030, and steep increase in the carbon price is required 
  thereafter to compensate for this inaction.In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction 
  in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual, 
  and carbon prices rise at a smoother rate. In Disorderly transition risk scnearios, the investments 
  in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase (e.g. annual investment 
  in low carbon technologies increases from ~750 billion USD to ~3 trillion USD 
  by 2050). Global mean temperatures are projected to increase across the world 
  by 1.6&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2050.
  
  The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could lead to chronic changes 
  in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity (a decrease in labour 
  productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical 
  labour under hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and 
  sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather 
  events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. 
  The total cumulative relative GDP impact is estimated to be between -4.2% 
  and -4.8% by 2050.

  The NGFS have provided two Disorderly scenarios:

  - **Divergent Net Zero** reaches Net Zero globally around 2050 but with higher
    costs in the short-term due to divergent policies being adopted across
    sectors leading to inefficiencies and a quicker phase out of oil use.

  - **Delayed transition** assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030.
    Strong policies are needed to limit warming to below 2&deg;C by 2050.
    CO<sub>2</sub> removal is limited.

  ### Key assumptions and parameters{.unlisted .unnumbered}

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, which results
  in emissions increasing until 2030. Policies drive a sharp decrease in
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand.
  In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis, which delays the increase of carbon
  prices until 2030, compared to the Divergent Net Zero scenario where carbon
  prices rise at a smoother rate because while there are varied policies
  implemented across countries and sectors these measures have been put in place
  earlier. In both the scenarios disorderly policy action results in transition
  risk.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase 
  in Disorderly transition risk scenarios. These are expected to be 
  higher in a Divergent compared to a Delayed scenario. Overall, firms could be 
  required to readjust their capital expenditure in line with these trends; 
  developing more efficient and less carbon intensive products and services in 
  order to adhere to carbon pricing policies. The technologies that result from 
  these investments could also adjust asset valuations of relatively older 
  technology. Annual investment in energy efficiency increases from around 200 
  billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between 600 billion USD 
  and 850 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon increases 
  from ~750 billion USD to ~3 trillion USD by 2050.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above 
  1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and 
  the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, 
  drought and heatwaves has already more than doubled (See Kaufman, D. et al. (2020).). 
  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere 
  are unprecedented in at least the  last 800,000 years and are extremely likely to have been 
  the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. In these scenarios global mean 
  temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 1.6&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, above 
  pre-industrial levels, by 2050 (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes 
  experiencing higher warming) giving rise to low physical risk.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. For example, 
  in the delayed transition risk scenario we could see the following:
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
    body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, 
    peaking at a ~140% over a  1986-2006 reference period around 2035, and 
    remaining around this level thereafter. Annual economic damages from 
    cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser extent; peaking at 
    ~20% above reference period levels around 2050.

  In these scenarios the total cumulative relative GDP impact is 
  estimated to be between -4.2% and -4.8% by 2050. World GDP losses from 
  physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over 
  time. World GDP impacts from Disorderly transition risks are negative 
  as the speed of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and 
  affects consumption and investment. In these scenarios, there is a large 
  mix of physical and transition risks in 2050.

  Overall, the Delayed transition scenario leaves a limited timeframe for countries, 
  companies and the population to adapt to climate change. The Divergent Net Zero 
  scenario will imply a higher cost to reach Net Zero by 2050 due to divergent policies.
