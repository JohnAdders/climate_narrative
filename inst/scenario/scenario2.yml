  Disorderly transition risk scenarios assume the introduction of effective policy change 
  is delayed or divergent across countries and sectors. In the Delayed transition scenario, 
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease until 2030, and a steep increase in the carbon price is required 
  thereafter to compensate for this inaction.In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction 
  in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual, 
  and carbon prices rise at a smoother rate. In Disorderly transition risk scenarios, the investments 
  in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase (e.g. annual investment 
  in low carbon technologies increases from ~850 billion USD to between ~2.5 trillion USD and 
  ~3 trillion USD by 2050). Global mean temperatures are projected to increase across the world 
  by 1.6&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2100 (with similar temperatures
  being reached as early as 2050).
  
  The Disorderly transition risk scenarios could lead to chronic changes 
  in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity (due to the 
  reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under hot 
  and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level 
  rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather 
  events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. 
  The total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and transition 
  effects relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks 
  is estimated to be between -4.6% and -4.7% by 2050.

  The NGFS have provided two Disorderly scenarios:

  - **Divergent Net Zero** reaches net zero globally around 2050 but with higher
    costs due to divergent policies introduced across sectors leading to a quicker 
    phase out of oil use.

  - **Delayed transition** assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030.
    Strong policies are needed to limit warming to below 2&deg;C. Negative emissions
    are limited.

  ### Key assumptions and parameters{.unlisted .unnumbered}

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19, which results
  in emissions increasing until 2030. Policies drive a sharp decrease in
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand.
  In the Divergent Net Zero scenario the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  starts to occur earlier and as a result is more gradual.

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction enables a "fossil
  recovery" out of the economic crisis, which delays the increase of carbon
  prices until 2030, compared to the Divergent Net Zero scenario where carbon
  prices rise at a smoother rate because while there are varied policies
  implemented across countries and sectors these measures have been put in place
  earlier. In both the scenarios disorderly policy action results in transition
  risk.

  Government revenues from carbon tax increase in line with the carbon price, until emissions 
  are reduced to a degree that this offsets carbon price increase. In Disorderly transition 
  risk scenarios, global government carbon tax revenues increase, peaking at ~4 trillion USD 
  (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) per year around 2025. In the Delayed transition scenario, 
  revenues peak at ~3 trillion USD  per year around 2035. In both scenarios revenues slope back 
  down to ~500 billion USD per year by 2050.

  In many countries, the implementation of carbon prices in the transition scenarios tends to 
  raise energy costs in the short-term, initially weighing down on prices (as lower demand 
  and financial market losses hit outputs). Rising carbon prices subsequently feed through 
  to modest increases in inflation and unemployment before returning to prior trends. In 
  some countries and time periods the offsetting positive growth effects from carbon revenue 
  recycling leads to a reduction in unemployment. Long-term interest rates tend to increase 
  in the transition scenarios, reflecting the inflationary pressure created by carbon prices, 
  as well as the increased investment demand that the transition spurs on. In the disorderly 
  scenarios policy uncertainty leads to a higher investment premium. This last for two years, 
  with the premium gradually returning to baseline thereafter. This occurs in the period 2021-2022 
  in the Divergent Net Zero policies scenario and 2030-2031 in the Delayed Transition scenario.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase 
  in Disorderly transition risk scenarios. These are expected to be 
  higher in a Divergent compared to a Delayed scenario. Overall, firms could be 
  required to readjust their capital expenditure in line with these trends; 
  developing more efficient and less carbon intensive products and services in 
  order to adhere to carbon pricing policies. The technologies that result from 
  these investments could also adjust asset valuations of relatively older 
  technology. Annual investment in energy efficiency increases from around 200 
  billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between ~600 billion USD 
  and ~900 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon increases 
  from ~850 billion USD to between ~2.5 trillion USD and ~3 trillion USD by 2050.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above 
  1.1&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and 
  the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, 
  drought and heatwaves has already more than doubled (See Lange, S. et al. (2020)). 
  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere 
  are unprecedented in at least the  last 800,000 years and are extremely likely to have been 
  the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. In these scenarios global mean 
  temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 1.6&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, above 
  pre-industrial levels, by 2100 (with similar temperatures being reached as early as 2050)
  giving rise to low physical risk (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes 
  experiencing higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. For example, 
  in the delayed transition risk scenario we could see the following:
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
    body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions. Although 
    this will depend on location, and in the UK this decrease may be relatively subdued.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, 
    peaking at a ~140% increase over a  1986-2006 reference period around 2035, and 
    remaining around this level thereafter. Annual economic damages from 
    cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser extent; peaking at 
    ~15% above reference period levels around 2040.

  In these scenarios the total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical 
  and transition effects relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks 
  is estimated to be just under -5% by 2050. World GDP losses from 
  physical risks vary in line with different temperatures projected for each scenario.
  World GDP impacts from Disorderly transition risks are negative as the speed of the 
  transition combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment. 
  In these scenarios, there is a large mix of physical and transition risks in 2050. Even 
  in the Delayed transition risk scenario, physical risks have a larger impact on global 
  GDP than transition risks. The NGFS estimate that global GDP impact in the Delayed transition 
  scenario will be around -4% by 2100.

Business confidence effect has been included in transition effect for Disorderly scenarios.

  Overall, the Delayed transition scenario leaves a limited timeframe for countries, 
  companies and the population to adapt to climate change. The Divergent Net Zero 
  scenario will imply a higher cost to reach Net Zero by 2050 due to divergent policies.
