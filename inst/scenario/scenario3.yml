  These scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some
  jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant
  global warming leading to high physical risk.

  The NGFS have provided two hot house world scenarios:

  - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) includes all pledged policies
    even if not yet implemented.

  - Current Policies assumes that only currently implemented policies are
    preserved, leading to high physical risk.

  ## Key physical assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease sufficiently to
  prevent significant temperature rises resulting in high physical risk.

  Carbon price is a measure of overall policy intensity. Emission prices are
  sensitive to the timing of policy implementation. With none or relatively
  small additions to current policy, these scenarios have low carbon prices
  throughout. Therefore, transition risk is not relevant for these scenarios.

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide 
  in the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and 
  are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the 
  mid-20th century. Observed climate change of 1.2&deg;C, compared to 
  pre-industrial levels, has already more than doubled both the global land area 
  and the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, 
  tropical cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves. In these scenarios global 
  mean temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 2.5&deg;C to 
  3&deg;C, or 3.7&deg;C to 4.8&deg;C at the 95th percentile (REMIND model), 
  with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher 
  warming.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding.

  In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -2.8% and -4.8%
  by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in temperatures 
  in the scenarios over time.

  Note: GDP losses highlighted in the above graph were calculated based on the 
  methodology set out in Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) at the country level for the 
  change in average temperature in each scenario compared to the previous year. 
  The methodology does not include impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level 
  rise or wider societal impacts from migration or conflict. For given countries 
  these would likely strongly increase the physical risk. These estimates also do 
  not fully capture adaptation, which would reduce impacts but require significant 
  investment.
  
  Selected climate variables can be explored through the NGFS CA Climate Impact
  Explorer hosted by Climate Analytics. Additional data are available via the
  ISIMIP project.

  Overall, these scenarios result in high physical risk including irreversible
  impacts like sea-level rise. Transition risks are not relevant in these
  scenarios as only policies that are already implemented or pledged are in
  place.
