  In the Hot House World scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease 
  and carbon price to not increase sufficiently to prevent significant 
  temperature rises resulting in high physical risk. In these scenarios 
  global mean temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 
  ~2&deg;C, or between 3.7&deg;C and 4.8&deg;C at the 95th percentile.
  
  This could lead to a significant chronic change in living conditions affecting 
  health, labour productivity (reduce capacity of the human body to perform 
  physical labour from ~0.035% in 2020 to ~0.275% by the end of the century), 
  agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also change the frequency 
  and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
  tropical cyclones, and flooding. The GDP losses are estimated to be between 
  -2.8% and-4.8% by 2050.

  These scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some
  jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant
  global warming leading to high physical risk.

  The NGFS have provided two hot house world scenarios:

  - **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** includes all pledged policies
    even if not yet implemented.

  - **Current Policies** assumes that only currently implemented policies are
    preserved, leading to high physical risk.

  ## Key physical assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease sufficiently to
  prevent significant temperature rises resulting in high physical risk.

  Carbon price is a measure of overall policy intensity. Emission prices are
  sensitive to the timing of policy implementation. With none or relatively
  small additions to current policy, these scenarios have low carbon prices
  throughout. Therefore, transition risk is not relevant for these scenarios.

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in
  the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are
  extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th
  century. Observed climate change of 1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels,
  has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global
  population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical cyclones,
  wildfire, drought and heatwaves. In these scenarios global mean temperatures
  are projected to increase across the world by ~2&deg;C, or between 3.7&deg;C and 4.8&deg;C
  at the 95th percentile (based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios REMIND model), 
  with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. For example, in 
  the Current Policies scenario we could see the following: 
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
    body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions worsens 
    from ~0.035% in 2020 to ~0.275% by the end of the century.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, peaking at 
    a ~200% increase over a 1986-2006 reference period around 2060. Annual economic damages 
    from tropical cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser extent; ~65% 
    above reference period levels by the end of the century.

  In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -2.8% and -4.8%
  by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in
  temperatures in the scenarios over time.

  The GDP losses highlighted in the below graph are calculated based on Kalkuhl and 
  Wenz (2020) methodology, at the country level for the change in average temperature 
  in each scenario compared to the previous year. This methodology does not include 
  impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level rise or wider societal impacts 
  from migration or conflict; these would likely strongly increase the physical 
  risk. These estimates also do not fully capture adaptation, which would reduce 
  impacts but require significant investment.

  Selected climate variables can be explored through the NGFS CA Climate Impact
  Explorer hosted by Climate Analytics. Additional data are available via the
  ISIMIP project.

  Overall, these scenarios result in high physical risk including irreversible
  impacts like sea-level rise. Transition risks are not relevant in these
  scenarios as only policies that are already implemented or pledged are in
  place.
