exec_description: |
  In the Hot House World scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease 
  and carbon prices to not increase sufficiently to prevent significant 
  temperature rises resulting in high physical risk. In these scenarios 
  global mean temperatures are projected to increase across the world by 
  ~2&deg;C compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2050.
  
  This could lead to a significant chronic change in living conditions affecting 
  health, labour productivity (a decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced 
  capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate 
  conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also change the 
  frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
  cyclones, and flooding. The total cumulative relative GDP impact is estimated 
  to be between -2.8% and -4.8% by 2050.

  These scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some
  jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant
  global warming leading to high physical risk.

  The NGFS have provided two hot house world scenarios:

  - **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** includes all pledged policies
    even if not yet implemented.

  - **Current Policies** assumes that only currently implemented policies are
    preserved, leading to high physical risk.

  ### Key physical assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios CO<sub>2</sub> emissions do not decrease sufficiently to
  prevent significant temperature rises resulting in high physical risk.

  Carbon price is a measure of overall policy intensity. Emission prices are
  sensitive to the timing of policy implementation. With none or relatively
  small additions to current policy, these scenarios have low carbon prices
  throughout. Therefore, transition risks ransition risks are much less significant
  in these scenarios.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected 
  to increase in Hot House scenarios. Annual investment in energy efficiency increases 
  from around 200 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between 250 
  billion USD and 350 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon 
  increases from ~750 billion USD to below ~2 trillion USD by 2050. However this 
  increase is relatively small compared to other scenarios.

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in
  the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are
  extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th
  century. Observed climate change of 1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels,
  has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global
  population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, 
  drought and heatwaves. In these scenarios global mean temperatures are 
  projected to increase across the world by ~2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial 
  levels, by 2050 (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing 
  higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. For example, in 
  the Current Policies scenario we could see the following: 
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
    body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, peaking at 
    a ~200% increase over a 1986-2006 reference period around 2060. Annual economic damages 
    from cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser extent; ~65% above reference 
    period levels by the end of the century.

  In these scenarios the total cumulative relative GDP impact is estimated to be 
  between -2.8% and -4.8% by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks scale with 
  the rise in temperatures in the scenarios over time.

  Overall, these scenarios result in high physical risk including irreversible
  impacts like sea-level rise. Transition risks are much less significant in these
  scenarios as only policies that are already implemented or pledged are in
  place.
