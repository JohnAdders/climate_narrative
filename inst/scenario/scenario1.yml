  The Orderly transition risk scenarios could result in a gradual 
  reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and an increase in the carbon price. 
  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase 
  (e.g. annual investment in low carbon increases from ~850 billion USD to between 
  ~2.5 trillion USD and ~3 trillion USD by 2030). Global mean temperatures are 
  projected to increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, compared to 
  pre-industrial levels, by 2100 (with similar temperatures being reached as early as 2050). 
  
  These scenarios could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting 
  health, labour productivity (a decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced 
  capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions), 
  agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and 
  severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. 
  The total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and transition effects relative to a baseline 
  with no transition or physical risks is estimated to be around -3% by 2050.

  These Orderly transition risk scenarios assume climate policies are introduced early and become 
  gradually more stringent. Both physical and transition risks are relatively subdued.

  The NGFS have defined two orderly scenarios:

  - **Net Zero 2050** limits global warming to 1.5&deg;C through stringent climate
    policies and innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
    around 2050. Some jurisdictions such as the US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia and
    Japan reach Net Zero for all GHGs.

  - **Below 2&deg;C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving
    a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2&deg;C.

  ### Key assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occurs gradually.
  This is achieved by an immediate and smooth policy reaction decarbonising the
  energy supply, accelerating electrification and switching to low-carbon fuels
  in industry, transport and buildings, deploying bioenergy with carbon capture
  and storage and increasing afforestation and reforestation.

  The price of carbon is higher in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to a Below
  2&deg;C scenario. This is due to more rigorous targets of limiting global warming
  to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C set in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. In both the scenarios
  the gradual but significant rise in emission prices gives rise to transition
  risk.

  Government revenues from carbon tax increase in line with the carbon price, until emissions are 
  reduced to a degree that this offsets carbon price increase. In Orderly transition risk scenarios, 
  global government carbon tax revenues increase, peaking at ~2.5 trillion USD (inflation adjusted to 
  2010 baseline) per year around 2025 before sloping back down to ~100 billion USD per year by 2050 in 
  the Net Zero 2050 scenario. In the Below 2&deg;C scenario, revenues peak at ~1.5 trillion USD  per year 
  around 2030 and remain at this level up to 2050.

  In many countries, the implementation of carbon prices in the transition scenarios tends to raise 
  energy costs in the short-term, initially weighing down on prices (as lower demand and financial 
  market losses hit outputs). Rising carbon prices subsequently feed through to modest increases in 
  inflation and unemployment before returning to prior trends. In some countries and time periods the 
  offsetting positive growth effects from carbon revenue recycling lead to a reduction in unemployment. 
  Long-term interest rates tend to increase in the transition scenarios, reflecting the inflationary 
  pressure created by carbon prices, as well as the increased investment demand that the transition 
  spurs on.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase 
  in Orderly transition risk scenarios. These are expected to be higher 
  in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to a Below 2&deg;C scenario. Overall, firms 
  could be required to readjust their capital expenditure in line with these 
  trends; developing more efficient and less carbon intensive products and 
  services in order to adhere to carbon pricing policies. The technologies 
  that result from these investments could also adjust asset valuations of 
  relatively older technology. Annual investment in energy efficiency increases 
  from ~200 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between ~600 
  billion USD and ~800 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low 
  carbon technologies increases from ~850 billion USD to between ~2.5 trillion USD and ~3 
  trillion USD by 2050.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above
  1.1&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and
  the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, 
  wildfire, drought and heatwaves has more than doubled. (See Lange, S. et al. (2020)).

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in
  the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are
  extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th
  century. In these scenarios global mean temperatures are projected to increase 
  across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.8&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels by 
  2100 (with similar temperatures being reached as early as 2050) giving rise to low physical risk
  (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. For example, 
  in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, we could see the following:
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
  body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions. Although 
  this will depend on location, and in the UK this decrease may be relatively subdued.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, 
  peaking at a ~120% increase over a 1986-2006 reference period around 2035, 
  and falling to ~95% above the reference period by the end of the century. Annual economic 
  damages from cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser extent; 
  ~10% above reference period levels from 2030 onwards.

  In these scenarios the total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and 
  transition effects relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks is 
  estimated to be around -3% by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in 
  line with different temperatures projected for each scenario. GDP impacts from 
  transition risk are moderately negative in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative 
  impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are only partially 
  offset by the recycling of carbon revenues into government investment and lower 
  employment taxes. In the orderly transition risk scenarios, physical risks have a 
  larger impact on global GDP than transition risk, even as early as 2030. The NGFS 
  estimate that global GDP impact in the Net Zero 2050 scenario will be around -3% by 
  2100.

Business confidence effect has been included in transition effect for Disorderly scenarios.

  Overall, these are relatively optimistic scenarios as both transition and
  physical risks are limited. Any policies that are either introduced or changed
  are assumed to take place efficiently with little variation between countries
  and sectors. Similarly, the development and deployment of alternative
  technologies are expected to take place without significant difficulty. For
  example, the availability of Carbon dioxide removal technologies which
  involves removing carbon from the atmosphere through increasing forest cover
  and soil sequestration or growing crops for bioenergy doesn't pose a
  significant challenge in either orderly scenario.
