  The Early/Orderly transition risk scenarios could result in a gradual 
  reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and an increase in the carbon price. 
  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon are projected to increase 
  (e.g. annual investment in low carbon increases from ~750 billion USD to between 
  ~2 trillion USD and ~3 trillion USD by 2030). The global mean temperatures are 
  projected to increase across the world by 1.6&deg;C to 1.7&deg;C, compared to 
  pre-industrial levels. 
  
  These scenarios could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting 
  health, labour productivity (reduce capacity of the human body to perform physical 
  labour from ~0.035% in 2020 to ~0.07% in 2050), agriculture, ecosystems, and 
  sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather 
  events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. 
  The GDP losses are estimated to be between -1.5% and -2.5% by 2050.

  The NGFS have defined two orderly scenarios:

  - **Net Zero 2050** limits global warming to 1.5&deg;C through stringent climate
    policies and innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
    around 2050. Some jurisdictions such as the US, EU and Japan reach Net Zero
    for all GHGs.

  - **Below 2&deg;C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving
    a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2&deg;C.

  ## Key assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occurs gradually.
  This is achieved by an immediate and smooth policy reaction decarbonising the
  energy supply, accelerating electrification and switching to low-carbon fuels
  in industry, transport and buildings, deploying bioenergy with carbon capture
  and storage and increasing afforestation.

  The price of carbon is higher in a Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to a Below
  2&deg;C scenario, this is due to more rigorous targets of limiting global warming
  to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C set in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. In both the scenarios
  the gradual but significant rise in emission prices gives rise to transition
  risk.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon are projected to increase 
  in early/orderly transition risk scenarios. These are expected to be higher 
  in a Below 2&deg;C scenario compared to a Net Zero 2050 scenario. Overall, firms 
  could be required to readjust their capital expenditure in line with these 
  trends; developing more efficient and less carbon intensive products and 
  services in order to adhere to carbon pricing policies. The technologies 
  that result from these investments could also adjust asset valuations of 
  relatively older technology. Annual investment in energy efficiency increases 
  from ~200 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to between ~500 
  billion USD and ~750 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low 
  carbon increases from ~750 billion USD to between ~2 trillion USD and ~3 
  trillion USD by 2030.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above
  1.2&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and
  the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, tropical
  cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves has more than doubled. (See Kaufman,
  D. et al. (2020)).

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in
  the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are
  extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th
  century. In these early/orderly transition risk scenarios global mean temperatures
  are projected to increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C to 1.7&deg;C, compared to
  pre-industrial levels, with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes
  experiencing higher warming giving rise to low physical risk.

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting
  health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It
  can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as
  heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and flooding. For example, 
  in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, we could see the following:
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human 
  body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions worsens 
  from ~0.035% in 2020 to ~0.07% in 2050. However, in this scenario, the decrease 
  lessens after 2050.

  * The annual economic damages from river floods are projected to increase, 
  peaking at a ~140% increase over a 1986-2006 reference period around 2050, 
  and remaining ~120% above the reference period thereafter. Annual economic 
  damages from tropical cyclones are also projected to increase, but to a lesser 
  extent; ~10% above reference period levels from 2030 onwards.

  In these scenarios the GDP losses are estimated to be between -1.5% and-2.5%
  by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks scale with the rise in
  temperatures in the scenarios over time. GDP impacts from transition risk are
  slightly positive in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative impacts on demand
  from higher carbon prices and energy costs are more than offset by the
  recycling of carbon tax revenues into government investment and lower
  employment taxes.

  The GDP losses highlighted in the below graph were calculated based on Kalkuhl 
  and Wenz (2020) methodology, at the country level for the change in average 
  temperature in each scenario compared to the previous year.
  This methodology does not include impacts related to extreme weather, sea-level
  rise or wider societal impacts from migration or conflict; 
  these would likely strongly increase the physical risk. These estimates also
  do not fully capture adaptation, which would reduce impacts but require
  significant investment.

  Overall, these are relatively optimistic scenarios as both transition and
  physical risks are limited. Any policies that are either introduced or changed
  are assumed to take place efficiently with little variation between countries
  and sectors. Similarly, the development and deployment of alternative
  technologies are expected to take place without significant difficulty. For
  example, the availability of Carbon dioxide removal technologies which
  involves removing carbon from the atmosphere through increasing forest cover
  and soil sequestration or growing crops for bioenergy doesn't pose a
  significant challenge in either orderly scenario.
