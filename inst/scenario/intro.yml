  ## Introduction
  
  In the Scenario Analysis Chapter of the Climate Financial Risk Forum 2021 Guide 
  published on 21st October, the Scenario Analysis Working Group included the 
  development of an online climate scenario analysis narrative tool to support 
  smaller firms as part of its future work programme.
  
  The Centre for Greening Finance and Investment have agreed to house the tool and 
  an IT solution is under development.
  
  The idea of the tool is that firms would input some basic information regarding 
  their business activities, products, or risks into the tool. The tool would then 
  output a report describing some of the potential climate-related risks and opportunities 
  for a selected NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly, or Hot House World).
  
  The report would summarise the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for 
  banks, insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, or 
  risks of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting 
  classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. 
  
  The tool is designed to be fully open source and the purpose of this document is to 
  record the contents to be used in the tool for different NGFS scenarios, lending exposure 
  types, underwriting classes, asset classes and economic sectors.
  
  The descriptions of the NGFS scenarios are based on the latest version of the scenarios 
  which were updated and expanded in June 2021. These were developed to provide a common 
  starting point for the financial sector to assess climate-related risks.
  
  The scenarios were primarily developed for central banks and supervisors, but they provide 
  a useful reference point for other financial institutions, including banks, asset 
  managers and insurers, when evaluating the impacts of climate-related risk to their 
  business.
  
  As well as a description for each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset 
  class and economic sector the following blocks of narrative are required to produce 
  the contents of the report for different NGFS scenarios:
  
  * Orderly transition --- Summary
  
  * Orderly transition --- Detail
  
  * Disorderly transition --- Summary
  
  * Disorderly transition --- Detail
  
  * Low physical risk --- Summary
  
  * Low physical risk --- Detail
  
  * High physical risk --- Summary
  
  * High physical risk --- Detail
  
  The table below describes which narrative blocks could be used for the report depending 
  on which NGFS scenario has been selected and whether or not the firm has indicated it 
  has an exposure to the lending type, underwriting class, asset class or economic sector 
  in question and if so whether that exposure is material for them.

  There are many uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario analysis. 
  Each report could include discussion of some of the key challenges facing the user of 
  scenario analysis and a disclaimer that the reports do not constitute financial or other 
  professional advice and should not be relied upon as such.

  ## Introduction to the Report
  
  This report summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for a firm 
  based on the materiality of exposures to different lending exposure types, underwriting 
  classes, asset classes, and economic sectors selected. These narratives are based on the 
  NGFS scenarios which were updated in June 2021.
  
  ### How can the report be used?
  
  The information provided by the tool and its associated reports aims to help firms better 
  understand their potential financial exposures to climate change. This information could 
  help them to start considering climate-related risks and opportunities within their 
  governance, strategy, risk management and reporting under the Task Force on Climate-Related 
  Financial Disclosures' (TCFD) recommendations. The information provided could also encourage 
  a more in-depth scenario analysis exercise to better understand the associated impact and 
  support decision making.
