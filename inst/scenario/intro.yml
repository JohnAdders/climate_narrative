  ## Introduction
  
  In the Scenario Analysis Chapter of the Climate Financial Risk Forum 2021 Guide 
  published on 21st October, the Scenario Analysis Working Group included the 
  development of an online climate scenario analysis narrative tool to support 
  smaller firms as part of its future work programme.
  
  The Centre for Greening Finance and Investment have agreed to house the tool and 
  an IT solution is under development.
  
  The idea of the tool is that firms would input some basic information regarding 
  their business activities, products, or risks into the tool. The tool would then 
  output a report describing some of the potential climate-related risks and opportunities 
  for a selected NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly, or Hot House World).
  
  The report would summarise the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for 
  banks, insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, or 
  risks of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting 
  classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. 
  
  The tool is designed to be fully open source and the purpose of this document is to 
  record the contents to be used in the tool for different NGFS scenarios, lending exposure 
  types, underwriting classes, asset classes and economic sectors.
  
  The descriptions of the NGFS scenarios are based on the latest version of the scenarios 
  which were updated and expanded in June 2021. These were developed to provide a common 
  starting point for the financial sector to assess climate-related risks.
  
  The scenarios were primarily developed for central banks and supervisors, but they provide 
  a useful reference point for other financial institutions, including banks, asset 
  managers and insurers, when evaluating the impacts of climate-related risk to their 
  business.
  
  As well as a description for each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset 
  class and economic sector the following blocks of narrative are required to produce 
  the contents of the report for different NGFS scenarios:
  
  * Orderly transition --- Summary
  
  * Orderly transition --- Detail
  
  * Disorderly transition --- Summary
  
  * Disorderly transition --- Detail
  
  * Low physical risk --- Summary
  
  * Low physical risk --- Detail
  
  * High physical risk --- Summary
  
  * High physical risk --- Detail
  
  The table below describes which narrative blocks could be used for the report depending 
  on which NGFS scenario has been selected and whether or not the firm has indicated it 
  has an exposure to the lending type, underwriting class, asset class or economic sector 
  in question and if so whether that exposure is material for them.

  There are many uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario analysis. 
  Each report could include discussion of some of the key challenges facing the user of 
  scenario analysis and a disclaimer that the reports do not constitute financial or other 
  professional advice and should not be relied upon as such.

  ## Target Audience
  
  The CFRF Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been written by a cross-industry 
  working group under the auspices of the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF). It is 
  aimed at banks, asset managers and insurers of all sizes, and may be of interest to 
  other institutions, such as pension schemes. 

  The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks, 
  insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks of 
  the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting classes, 
  asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. 

  ## How can the tool be used?
  
  Firms are required to input some basic information regarding their business activities, 
  products, or risks into the tool. The tool would then output an executive summary and 
  a detail report.

  Firms will be required to select their level of exposure, to an asset class, sector, or liability class, from one of the following: 
  
  * High: One of your top 5 exposures or more than 10% of total assets
  
  * Medium: 5% - 10% of total assets
  
  * Low: below 5% of total assets
  
  Based on the level of exposure selected, the tool will output different levels of detail 
  in the report. Where low or medium are selected the tool will output a summary narrative 
  for that exposure. Where high is selected the tool will output the summary as well as a 
  more detailed narrative for that exposure.
  
  The executive summary covers the following:
  
  - a description and a summary of key assumptions and parameters of selected NGFS scenario 
  (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly, or Hot House World). These descriptions are based on the NGFS 
  scenarios which were updated in June 2021. 
  
  - by sectors, underwriting and asset classes as well as lending exposure types (ordered 
  by materiality i.e. high/medium/low):
  
    -	tables summarising the selected exposure type and highlighting the materiality (in 
    line with inputs to the online tool).
    
    -	a summary (for each selected high materiality exposure) covering some of the 
    potential climate-related risks and opportunities supported by the NGFS variables and a 
    table of one-liners (for selected medium/low materiality exposures).
    
  The long form report covers the following:
   
  * a description and key assumptions and parameters of selected NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, 
  Disorderly, or Hot House World). These descriptions are based on the NGFS scenarios which 
  were updated in June 2021. 
   
  * by sectors, underwriting and asset classes as well as lending exposure types (ordered 
  by materiality i.e. high/medium/low):
   
  * a description of each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and sector 
  selected.
   
  * detail narratives (for high materiality exposures) covering some of the potential 
  climate-related risks and opportunities supported by the NGFS variables and a 
  summary (for medium/low materiality)
   
  There are many uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario 
  analysis. For example, The CFRF Online Scenario Analysis Narrative Tool is not 
  updated on an ongoing basis. It draws heavily on the climate scenarios designed 
  by the NGFS (updated in June 2021) to aid users' understanding of their 
  potential financial exposures to a set of highly stylised transition and 
  physical climate-related risks and opportunities. The results are in turn 
  underpinned by a single energy systems model --- REMIND --- which makes particular 
  assumptions about long-term technology pathways that are of course highly uncertain.
  
  This scenario and modelling framework is very useful for climate reporting 
  and risk assessments. However, a limitation for those seeking to embed 
  climate-related risks and opportunities into their investment decision making 
  and risk management framework is that it does not specify a baseline related 
  directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful 
  variation in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and 
  sectors, nor alternative technology pathways.
   
  For example, the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price 
  for the global power and transportation sectors, as well as between, say EU and 
  US and China. Similarly, the tool does not provide a mechanism to really test 
  how financial exposures may differ if the very solar PV friendly technology pathways 
  of the REMIND model does not come to pass. Relaxing these policy and technology 
  universality assumptions will naturally generate quite different assessments 
  of the climate exposures of different financial securities and assets.

  There are many potential ways to incorporate more plausible policy pathways 
  and a wider range of technology pathways into climate scenario analyses. One 
  of these has been designed by abrdn in partnership with Planetrics. This 
  approach creates scenarios that allow for climate policy objectives to vary 
  across the major emitting regions and sectors. It also allows for the 
  interaction between these plausible policy variations and alternative technology 
  pathways to be explored. All financial impairment estimates are then calculated 
  relative to a baseline assessment of what is priced into assets at any given 
  point in time.
   
  This framework also has the virtue of filling in some of the 'probability mass' 
  that sits between transition-heavy scenarios that are strongly or weakly aligned 
  with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and those that are dominated by 
  physical risks.
   
  During 2022, we will continue to collect feedback and we will update the 
  tool in Q1 2023.
