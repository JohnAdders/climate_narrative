  ## Introduction to the Executive Summary and the long form Report
  
  This report summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for a firm based 
  on the materiality of exposures to different lending exposure types, underwriting classes, 
  asset classes, and economic sectors selected. These narratives draw on data from the NGFS scenarios 
  which were updated in September 2022. Users who wish to learn more about the NGFS scenarios are directed to 
  the [NGFS scenario portal](https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/){target="\_blank"}.
