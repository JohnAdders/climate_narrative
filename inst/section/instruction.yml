  This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support firms
  in assessing their climate-related risks and opportunities.
  
  ### Target audience
  
  The CFRF Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been written by a 
  cross-industry working group under the auspices of the Climate Financial 
  Risk Forum (CFRF). It is aimed at banks, asset managers and insurers of all 
  sizes, and may be of interest to other institutions, such as pension schemes. 
  
  The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for 
  banks, insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, 
  or risks of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, 
  underwriting classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. These 
  descriptions are based on the NGFS scenarios which were updated in June 2021.
  
  ### How can the tool be used?
  
  Firms are required to input some basic information regarding their business activities, 
  products, and materiality of exposure to an asset class, sector, or liability class, 
  as follows: 
  
  - High: One of your top 5 exposures or more than 10% of total assets
  - Medium: 5% - 10% of total assets
  - Low: below 5% of total assets
  
  Users will then select the relevant NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly, or Hot House 
  World) and/or sector which will generate an output. This will be in the form of an executive 
  summary and a detailed long form report. Based on materiality and the NGFS scenario selected, 
  the tool will output different levels of detail in the reports. Where low or medium materiality 
  are selected for a business activity, the tool will output a summary narrative. Where high materiality 
  is selected, the tool will output a more detailed narrative.
      
  The executive summary covers the following:
  
  - A summary of the key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type 
  (ordered from high to low materiality):
    - Tables summarising the selected exposure type and highlighting the materiality
    - A summary for high materiality exposures
    - A table of one-liners for medium and low materiality exposures
      
  The long form report covers the following:
    
  - A description of key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
  (ordered from high to low materiality):
    - A description of each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and sector selected
    - Detail narratives for high materiality exposures
    - A summary for medium and low materiality

  The tool will also generate a report covering a stand-alone description for an 
  underwriting class or economic sector in a particular NGFS scenario.
