  This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support firms
  in assessing their climate-related risks and opportunities.

  ## Purpose

  The CFRF Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been written by a cross-industry
  working group under the auspices of the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF).
  It is aimed at banks, asset managers and insurers of all sizes, and may be of interest
  to other institutions, such as pension schemes.

  The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks,
  insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks
  of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting classes,
  asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. The descriptions draw on data 
  from the latest scenarios developed by the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening 
  the Financial System (NGFS) which were updated in June 2021. 
  
  The NGFS scenarios explore a range of transition and physical risks and are defined as follows:
  
    - **Orderly transition risk scenarios** assume that effective policy changes are introduced in 
      a timely manner, limiting physical and transition risks.
    - **Disorderly transition risk scenarios** assume that the introduction of effective policy 
      change is delayed or divergent, leading to elevated transition risks and limited physical risks.
    - **Hot house world scenarios** assume that some climate policies are implemented in some 
      jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming, 
      leading to high physical risk.
  
  The NGFS scenarios are underpinned by Integrated Assessment Models such as GCAM, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM 
  and REMIND-MAgPIE  (covering mainly transition risks and using global databases), as well as the NGFS 
  Climate Impact Explorer (covering physical risk and using UK-specific databases). The outputs from these 
  scenarios are used as input to the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM), to derive 
  corresponding macroeconomic variables (e.g. change in GDP, consumption, investments, interest rates) 
  for numerous regions and countries.
  
  The NGFS scenarios are further detailed in the [NGFS scenario portal](https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/).

  ## How to use the tool?

  The tool can generate two types of report:

    - an Institutional Report which gives a report tailored to your institution
    - a Sector Report which allows users to see the content for an individual sector

  ### Institutional Report

  Selecting this report type will take you to a series of screens where you need
  to input some basic information regarding your firm's business activities,
  products, and materiality of exposures to an asset class, sector, or liability class.

  Materiality is entered based on:

  - High: One of your top 5 exposures or more than 10% of total assets
  - Medium: 5% - 10% of total assets
  - Low: below 5% of total assets
  - N/A: negligible or no exposure

  The tool outputs an executive summary and a detailed long form report.
  Based on materiality and the NGFS scenario selected, the tool will output different
  levels of detail in the reports. Where low or medium materiality are selected, the tool
  will output a summary narrative. Where high materiality is selected, the tool will output
  a more detailed narrative.

  ### Sector Report

  Selecting this report type will take you straight to the final report page which will
  allow you to select the detailed narrative by sector and climate scenario.

  ## Report Structure

  On the final report page select the relevant NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly,
  or Hot House World) and for Sector Report also pick a sector.

  The executive summary covers the following:

  - A summary of the key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
     (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - Tables summarising the selected exposure type and highlighting the materiality
    - A summary narrative for high materiality exposures
    - A table of one-liners for medium and low materiality exposures

  The long form report covers the following:
    
  - A more detailed description of key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
    (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - A description of each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and sector selected
    - Detailed narratives for high materiality exposures
    - A summary narrative for medium and low materiality exposures

  The tool will also generate a report covering a stand-alone description for an 
  underwriting class or economic sector in a particular NGFS scenario.

  ## Limitations

  There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool; for example: The tool 
  is not updated on an ongoing basis. It draws heavily on the NGFS scenarios (updated in June 2021). 
  The results are in turn underpinned by a single energy systems model --- REMIND --- which makes particular 
  assumptions about long-term technology pathways that are of course highly uncertain.

  This tool may be useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation
  for those seeking to embed climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management framework 
  and investment decision making is that it does not specify a baseline related
  directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful variation
  in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative
  technology pathways.

  For example, the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global
  power and transportation sectors. Whereas in the Net Zero 2050 scenario there are regional differences in carbon price, 
  and in the Divergent Net Zero scenario there are sectoral differences in carbon price, as well as between, say EU and US 
  and China. Similarly, the tool does not provide a mechanism to test how financial exposures may differ if the
  solar PV friendly technology pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these policy and technology 
  universality assumptions will naturally generate quite different assessments of the climate exposures of different financial 
  securities and assets.

  There are many potential ways to incorporate more alternative plausible policy pathways and a wider range of
  technology pathways into climate scenario analyses. See, for example, section 6 of the CFRF 2021 Scenario Analysis 
  Guide which discusses one approach based on some work done by Abrdn  (a UK-based global investment company). Such 
  approaches create a richer set of scenarios that allow, for example, for climate policy objectives to vary across 
  the major emitting regions and sectors and for some of the 'probability mass' that sits between transition-heavy scenarios 
  that are strongly or weakly aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and those that are dominated by physical risks. 
  This in turn enables financial impairment estimates to be calculated relative to a baseline assessment of what is priced into assets 
  at any given point in time.
  
  Note that the tool draws transition and physical variables from the NGFS database, which are  just examples of climate impacts and 
  views across the scientific community are still evolving in some areas. 

  ### What is next?

  The tool is housed on the Centre for Greening Finance and Investment climate and environmental data and analytics platform. 
  During 2022, the Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will continue to collect feedback from users 
  on this beta version of the tool and will update the tool to enhance content and reflect the latest NGFS scenarios in Q1 2023.
