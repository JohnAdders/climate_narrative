  This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support firms
  in assessing their climate-related risks and opportunities.

  ## Target audience

  The CFRF Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been written by a cross-industry
  working group under the auspices of the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF).
  It is aimed at banks, asset managers and insurers of all sizes, and may be of interest
  to other institutions, such as pension schemes.

  The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks,
  insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks
  of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting classes,
  asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. These descriptions are based on
  the NGFS scenarios which were updated in June 2021.

  ## How to use the tool?

  The tool can generate 2 types of report:

    - an Institutional Report which gives a report tailored to your institution
    - a Sector Report which allows users to see the content for an individual sector

  ### Institutional Report

  Selecting this report type will then take to to a series of screens where you need
  to input some basic information regarding your firms business activities,
  products, and materiality of exposures to an asset class, sector, or liability class.

  Matriality is entered based on:

  - High: One of your top 5 exposures or more than 10% of total assets
  - Medium: 5% - 10% of total assets
  - Low: below 5% of total assets
  - N/A: negligible or no exposure

  The tool outputs an executive summary and a detailed long form report.
  Based on materiality and the NGFS scenario selected, the tool will output different
  levels of detail in the reports. Where low or medium materiality are selected, the tool
  will output a summary narrative. Where high materiality is selected, the tool will output
  a more detailed narrative.

  ### Sector Report

  Selecting this report type will take you straight to the final report page which will
  allow you to select the detailed narrative by sector and climate scenario.

  ## Report Structure

  On the final report page select the relevant NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly,
  or Hot House World) and for Sector Report also pick a sector.

  The executive summary covers the following:

  - A summary of the key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
     (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - Tables summarising the selected exposure type and highlighting the materiality
    - A summary narrative for high materiality exposures
    - A table of one-liners for medium and low materiality exposures

  The long form report covers the following:
    
  - A more detailed description of key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
    (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - A description of each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and sector selected
    - Detailed narratives for high materiality exposures
    - A summary narrative for medium and low materiality exposures

  The tool will also generate a report covering a stand-alone description for an 
  underwriting class or economic sector in a particular NGFS scenario.

  ## Limitations

  There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the CFRF Online Scenario
  Analysis Narrative Tool; for example: The tool is not updated on an ongoing basis. It draws
  heavily on the NGFS scenarios (updated in June 2021). The results are in turn underpinned by
  a single energy systems model --- REMIND --- which makes particular assumptions about long-term
  technology pathways that are of course highly uncertain.

  This tool is very useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation
  for those seeking to embed climate-related risks and opportunities into their investment
  decision making and risk management framework is that it does not specify a baseline related
  directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful variation
  in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative
  technology pathways.

  For example, the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global
  power and transportation sectors, as well as between, say EU and US and China. Similarly, the
  tool does not provide a mechanism to really test how financial exposures may differ if the very
  solar PV friendly technology pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these
  policy and technology universality assumptions will naturally generate quite different assessments
  of the climate exposures of different financial securities and assets.

  There are many potential ways to incorporate more plausible policy pathways and a wider range of
  technology pathways into climate scenario analyses. One of these has been designed by abrdn in
  partnership with Planetrics. This approach creates scenarios that allow for climate policy objectives
  to vary across the major emitting regions and sectors. It also allows for the interaction between
  these plausible policy variations and alternative technology pathways to be explored. All financial
  impairment estimates are then calculated relative to a baseline assessment of what is priced into
  assets at any given point in time.

  This framework also has the virtue of filling in some of the 'probability mass' that sits between
  transition-heavy scenarios that are strongly or weakly aligned with the objectives of the Paris
  Agreement and those that are dominated by physical risks.

  ### What is next?

  The Centre for Greening Finance and Investment have agreed to house the tool on
  their IT platform.  The tool will be released publically in Q2 2022 after further testing.

  During the remainder of 2022, the Climate Financial Risk Forum
  Scenario Analysis Working Group will continue to collect feedback from users and will update the
  tool to enhance content and reflect the latest NGFS scenarios in Q1 2023.
