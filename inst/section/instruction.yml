  This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support firms
  in assessing their climate-related risks and opportunities.

  ## Target audience

  The CFRF Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been written by a cross-industry
  working group under the auspices of the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF).
  It is aimed at banks, asset managers and insurers of all sizes, and may be of interest
  to other institutions, such as pension schemes.

  The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks,
  insurers and asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks
  of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting classes,
  asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. These descriptions are based on
  the NGFS scenarios which were updated in June 2021.

  ## How to use the tool?

  The tool can generate 2 types of report:

    - an Institutional Report which gives a report tailored to your institution
    - a Sector Report which allows users to see the content for an individual sector

  ### Institutional Report

  Selecting this report type will then take to to a series of screens where you need
  to input some basic information regarding your firms business activities,
  products, and materiality of exposures to an asset class, sector, or liability class.

  Matriality is entered based on:

  - High: One of your top 5 exposures or more than 10% of total assets
  - Medium: 5% - 10% of total assets
  - Low: below 5% of total assets
  - N/A: negligible or no exposure

  The tool outputs an executive summary and a detailed long form report.
  Based on materiality and the NGFS scenario selected, the tool will output different
  levels of detail in the reports. Where low or medium materiality are selected, the tool
  will output a summary narrative. Where high materiality is selected, the tool will output
  a more detailed narrative.

  ### Sector Report

  Selecting this report type will take you straight to the final report page which will
  allow you to select the detailed narrative by sector and climate scenario.

  ## Report Structure

  On the final report page select the relevant NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly,
  or Hot House World) and for Sector Report also pick a sector.

  The executive summary covers the following:

  - A summary of the key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
     (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - Tables summarising the selected exposure type and highlighting the materiality
    - A summary for high materiality exposures
    - A table of one-liners for medium and low materiality exposures

  The long form report covers the following:

  - A description of key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
    (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - A description of each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and
      sector selected
    - Detail narratives for high materiality exposures
    - A summary for medium and low materiality
