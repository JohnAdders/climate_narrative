  ### How can the report be used?

  The information provided by the CFRF Online Scenario Analysis Narrative Tool and its
  associated reports aims to help firms start to better understand their potential financial exposures
  to climate change. This information could help them to start considering climate-related risks
  and opportunities within their governance, strategy, risk management and reporting under the
  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD) recommendations. The information
  provided could also encourage a more in-depth scenario analysis exercise to better understand
  the associated impact and support decision making. However, the observations in this report do
  not constitute financial or other professional advice and should not be relied upon as such.

  ### Limitations

  There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool; for example: The
  tool is not updated on an ongoing basis. It draws
  heavily on the NGFS scenarios (updated in June 2021). The results are in turn underpinned by
  a single energy systems model (REMIND) which makes particular assumptions about long-term
  technology pathways that are of course highly uncertain.

  This tool may be useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation
  for those seeking to embed climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management
  framework and investment decision making is that it does not specify a baseline related
  directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful variation
  in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative
  technology pathways.

  For example, the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global
  power and transportation sectors. Whereas in the Net Zero 2050 scenario there are regional differences in carbon price,
  and in the Divergent Net Zero scenario there are sectoral differences in carbon price, as well as between, say EU and US
  and China. Similarly, the tool does not provide a mechanism to test how financial exposures may differ if the
  solar PV friendly technology pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these policy and technology
  universality assumptions will naturally generate quite different assessments of the climate exposures of different financial
  securities and assets.

  There are many potential ways to incorporate alternative plausible policy pathways and a wider range of
  technology pathways into climate scenario analyses. See, for example, section 6 of the CFRF 2021 Scenario
  Analysis Guide which discusses one approach based on some work done by Abrdn  (a UK-based global investment
  company). Such approaches create a richer set of scenarios that allow, for example, for climate policy objectives
  to vary across the major emitting regions and sectors and for some of the 'probability mass' that sits between
  transition-heavy scenarios that are strongly or weakly aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and
  those that are dominated by physical risks. This in turn enables financial impairment estimates to be calculated
  relative to a baseline assessment of what is priced into assets at any given point in time.

  ### What is next?

  The tool is housed on the Centre for Greening Finance and Investment climate and environmental data and analytics platform.
  During 2022, the Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will continue to collect feedback from users
  on this beta version of the tool up to Q3 2022 and will update the tool to enhance content and reflect the latest NGFS scenarios in Q1 2023.
