  ### How can the report be used?

  The information provided by the CFRF Online Scenario Analysis Narrative Tool and its
  associated reports aims to help firms start to better understand their potential financial exposures
  to climate change. This information could help them to start considering climate-related risks
  and opportunities within their governance, strategy, risk management and reporting under the
  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD) recommendations. The information
  provided could also encourage a more in-depth scenario analysis exercise to better understand
  the associated impact and support decision making. However, the observations in this report do
  not constitute financial or other professional advice and should not be relied upon as such.

  ## Limitations

  There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool, for example: The tool
  is not updated on an ongoing basis. It draws heavily on the NGFS scenarios (updated in September 2022).
 
  The scenarios are neither a forecast of what is likely to happen nor a description of what should happen, but 
  an illustration of what could happen (this does include some adverse scenarios, however the global spike in energy prices 
  in 2022, due in part to the war in Ukraine, was both more adverse and more immediate than any of the scenarios designed ex 
  ante - the NGFS published a [note](https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/media/2022/09/07/not_too_late_-_confronting_the_growing_odds_of_a_late_and_disorderly_transition.pdf)
  to demonstrate the relevance of the NGFS scenarios to this situation). The NGFS scenarios are underpinned by a subset 
  of models, e.g. REMIND, GCAM and MESSAGE, which make particular assumptions about long-term technology pathways that are 
  of course highly uncertain. Such models also assume smooth adjustment processes and largely proxy climate policy through 
  carbon pricing.

  This tool may be useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation
  for those seeking to embed climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management framework
  and investment decision making is that it does not specify a baseline related
  directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful variation
  in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative
  technology pathways.

  For example, the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global
  power and transportation sectors. Whereas in the Net Zero 2050 scenario there are regional differences in carbon price,
  and in the Divergent Net Zero scenario there are sectoral differences in carbon price, as well as between, say EU and US
  and China. Similarly, the tool does not provide a mechanism to test how financial exposures may differ if the
  solar friendly technology pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these policy and technology
  universality assumptions will naturally generate quite different assessments of the climate exposures of different financial
  securities and assets.

  There are many potential ways to incorporate more alternative plausible policy pathways and a wider range of
  technology pathways into climate scenario analyses. See, for example, section 6 of the CFRF 2021 Scenario Analysis
  Guide which discusses one approach based on some work done by Abrdn  (a UK-based global investment company). Such
  approaches create a richer set of scenarios that allow, for example, for climate policy objectives to vary across
  the major emitting regions and sectors and for the outcomes that sit between transition-heavy scenarios
  and those that are dominated by physical risks. This in turn enables financial impairment estimates to be calculated 
  relative to a baseline assessment of what is priced into assets at any given point in time.
  
  ### What is next?

  The Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will update the tool periodically to enhance content, including 
  to reflect future updates to NGFS scenarios.
