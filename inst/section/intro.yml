  ## Introduction to the Report

  This report summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for a firm based
  on the materiality of exposures to different lending exposure types, underwriting classes,
  asset classes, and economic sectors selected. These narratives are based on the NGFS scenarios
  which were updated in June 2021.

  ### How can the report be used?

  The information provided by the tool and its associated reports aims to help firms better
  understand their potential financial exposures to climate change. This information could
  help them to start considering climate-related risks and opportunities within their governance,
  strategy, risk management and reporting under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
  Disclosures' (TCFD) recommendations. The information provided could also encourage a more
  in-depth scenario analysis exercise to better understand the associated impact and support
  decision making.

  ### Limitations

  There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the CFRF Online Scenario
  Analysis Narrative Tool; for example: The tool is not updated on an ongoing basis. It draws
  heavily on the NGFS scenarios (updated in June 2021). The results are in turn underpinned by
  a single energy systems model --- REMIND --- which makes particular assumptions about long-term
  technology pathways that are of course highly uncertain.

  This tool is very useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation
  for those seeking to embed climate-related risks and opportunities into their investment
  decision making and risk management framework is that it does not specify a baseline related
  directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful variation
  in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative
  technology pathways.

  For example, the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global
  power and transportation sectors, as well as between, say EU and US and China. Similarly, the
  tool does not provide a mechanism to really test how financial exposures may differ if the very
  solar PV friendly technology pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these
  policy and technology universality assumptions will naturally generate quite different assessments
  of the climate exposures of different financial securities and assets.

  There are many potential ways to incorporate more plausible policy pathways and a wider range of
  technology pathways into climate scenario analyses. One of these has been designed by abrdn in
  partnership with Planetrics. This approach creates scenarios that allow for climate policy objectives
  to vary across the major emitting regions and sectors. It also allows for the interaction between
  these plausible policy variations and alternative technology pathways to be explored. All financial
  impairment estimates are then calculated relative to a baseline assessment of what is priced into
  assets at any given point in time.

  This framework also has the virtue of filling in some of the 'probability mass' that sits between
  transition-heavy scenarios that are strongly or weakly aligned with the objectives of the Paris
  Agreement and those that are dominated by physical risks.

  ### What is next?

  The Centre for Greening Finance and Investment have agreed to house the tool on
  their IT platform.  The tool will be released publically in Q2 2022 after further testing.

  During the remainder of 2022, the Climate Financial Risk Forum
  Scenario Analysis Working Group will continue to collect feedback from users and will update the
  tool to enhance content and reflect the latest NGFS scenarios in Q1 2023.
