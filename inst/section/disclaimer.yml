  This tool represents output from the cross-industry
  Scenario Analysis Working Group of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial
  Conduct Authority's Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF). It is currently under development.
  During 2022, the CFRF Scenario Analysis Working Group will
  continue to collect feedback from users on this beta version of the tool up to Q3 2022
  and will update the tool to enhance content and reflect the latest Network for Greening
  the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios in Q1 2023.

  The PRA and FCA have convened and facilitated CFRF discussions but do not accept
  liability for the views expressed in this guide which do not necessarily represent
  the view of the regulators and in any case do not constitute regulatory guidance.

  The tool references data from the NGFS scenarios which were updated in June 2021.
  However, the tool has not been endorsed by the NGFS. Users who wish to learn more
  about the NGFS scenarios are directed to the NGFS scenario portal.
